Both experimental investigations and computational simulations have reported conflicting results regarding the preferred adsorption site of CO on Pt(111). Experimentally, a variety of surface\u2010sensitive techniques, including low\u2010energy electron diffraction (LEED), infrared spectroscopy, and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), consistently indicate that CO adsorbs predominantly on top of individual Pt atoms at low coverages. In contrast, density functional theory (DFT) calculations employing standard local and semilocal exchange\u2013correlation (XC) functionals often predict that CO should favor the higher coordinated hollow or bridge sites, with energy differences on the order of tens to hundreds of meV. In addition, detailed computational studies have emphasized the sensitivity of results to the approximations used, including the choice of XC functional, the degree of numerical convergence, the slab model, k-point sampling, and the applied smearing methods. This report reviews and synthesizes the previously reported experimental results and computational findings regarding CO adsorption on Pt(111) and describes the best practices for computing this property using DFT, with an emphasis on validated guidelines for exchange\u2013correlation functionals, k-point sampling, slab models, and convergence criteria (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11).\n\nI. Introduction  \nThe interaction of carbon monoxide with platinum surfaces is of paramount importance in catalysis, particularly in applications ranging from automotive exhaust treatment to fuel cell technology. Despite the widespread use of Pt-catalysts, the precise adsorption site of CO on Pt(111) remains a topic of debate due to conflicting evidence arising from experimental measurements versus theoretical predictions. Experimentally, a consensus has emerged that at low coverage, CO binds preferentially to atop sites on the Pt(111) surface, providing strong evidence from techniques such as LEED, STM, and vibrational spectroscopy (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4). However, early computational studies based on density functional theory (DFT) repeatedly favored adsorption at the threefold hollow sites, particularly the face\u2010centered cubic (fcc) hollow position, with energy differences between sites sometimes varying by 0.1\u20130.25 eV (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, kuwabara2008firstprinciplescalculation pages 2-3). This inconsistency is known as the \u201cCO/Pt(111) puzzle\u201d and highlights the extreme sensitivity of DFT results to the specific computational details employed (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16).  \n\nThis report critically examines the literature to clarify both the experimental observations and the computational predictions regarding the adsorption geometry of CO on Pt(111). Moreover, it aims to provide detailed guidelines for using DFT to compute the adsorption energies and geometries of CO on Pt(111), considering the validated and recommended computational parameters such as exchange-correlation functionals, k-point sampling, slab models, and convergence criteria. A high level of numerical rigor and methodological care is essential to obtain reliable and reproducible predictions that can reconcile the differences between theoretical and experimental findings (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7).\n\nII. Experimental Observations  \nExperimental studies on CO adsorption on Pt(111) provide a diverse set of observations that consistently indicate a strong site preference for atop adsorption under low-pressure, low-coverage conditions. LEED investigations, for example, have shown that in structures such as the c(4\u00d72)-CO/Pt(111) overlayer, CO molecules adopt configurations in which one molecule is terminally bonded (on top) and another is in a twofold coordinated bridge geometry (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11). In these experiments, measurements indicate that approximately 88% of CO molecules are found at the atop sites, with the remaining 12% occupying bridge sites, thereby strongly supporting a terminal adsorption model (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, grinberg2002coonpt pages 1-4).  \n\nVibrational spectroscopy studies, including infrared absorption and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), also provide evidence in favor of atop adsorption. The characteristic C\u2013O stretching frequencies observed under ultra-high vacuum and moderate-pressure conditions are consistent with a linear, terminal bonding geometry. For instance, experiments report that the stretching frequency of on-top-bound CO shows a blue-shift as pressure increases, which is conventionally interpreted as reflecting changes in the CO\u2013Pt bond strength under different adsorption geometries (rupprechter2001highpressurecarbonmonoxide pages 1-2, rupprechter2001highpressurecarbonmonoxide pages 4-5). Additionally, high-pressure studies have confirmed that, even across a wide range of pressures (from 10^\u20137 to several hundred mbar) and temperatures (160 to 400 K), the predominant CO species is the on-top adsorbate (rupprechter2001highpressurecarbonmonoxide pages 4-5).  \n\nFurther evidence comes from STM measurements, which have visualized the spatial distribution of CO molecules on Pt(111), reinforcing the conclusion that at low coverages CO preferentially occupies the atop positions on flat Pt(111) terraces. These experimental findings are further reinforced by additional techniques such as x-ray photoemission spectroscopy and charge displacement experiments, which have shown that the CO adsorption energy and bonding geometry are highly sensitive to surface imperfections, with enhanced adsorption observed at defect and step-edge sites \u2013 a phenomenon that has been attributed to local ligand effects (gauthier2001adsorptionsitesand pages 1-2, gauthier2001adsorptionsitesand pages 2-3). This body of experimental evidence strongly suggests that for pristine Pt(111) surfaces under typical experimental conditions, the most stable adsorption configuration for CO is the atop site (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4).\n\nIII. Computational Simulations and the \u201cCO/Pt(111) Puzzle\u201d  \nOver the past decades, computational studies based on DFT have aimed to reproduce the experimentally observed adsorption behavior of CO on Pt(111). Early DFT calculations, employing local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functionals such as PW91 and PBE, often predicted a preference for higher coordination sites, such as the threefold fcc or hcp hollow sites, over the on-top position (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, kuwabara2008firstprinciplescalculation pages 2-3). These discrepancies between theory and experiment became widely known, and the \u201cCO/Pt(111) puzzle\u201d emerged as a central problem in computational surface science (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7, grinberg2002coonpt pages 4-8).  \n\nSeveral details contribute to this problem. A key factor is the sensitivity of the predicted adsorption energy differences to the choice of the XC functional. For instance, while standard GGA functionals usually yield a relative stabilization of the hollow sites by as much as 0.13\u20130.24 eV, hybrid functionals such as B3LYP have been shown to favor the top site, thereby bringing theoretical predictions closer to experimental observations (gajdo2004coadsorptionon pages 13-14, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7). Nevertheless, even the use of hybrid functionals does not entirely resolve the discrepancy when applied to the Pt(111) surface; some calculations indicate that the top and hcp sites become nearly degenerate, while others still suggest that the hollow site retains a slight energetic advantage (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 7-10, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7).  \n\nIn addition to the XC functional, other computational factors contribute to differences in reported adsorption geometries. The size of the model used to represent the Pt(111) surface is critical: smaller cluster models tend to exaggerate the stability of the hollow site, whereas larger periodic slab models, which more accurately capture the extended electronic structure of the metal, can yield results that are more in line with experimental findings when combined with properly converged parameters (gajdo2004coadsorptionon pages 13-14, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7). For example, at low coverages of approximately 0.25 monolayers, some DFT calculations demonstrate that the binding energies for various adsorption sites are narrowly clustered, with the fcc hollow site sometimes being marginally more favorable by ~0.1 eV compared to the top site (shan2009coveragedependentcoadsorption pages 1-2). On the other hand, other simulations emphasize that a maximum adsorption stability is reached when accounting for the correct balance of through-space repulsion and charge transfer effects, indicating that an accurate description of these subtle energetic differences is essential (gunasooriya2018coadsorptionon pages 6-8, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 16-20).  \n\nFurthermore, theoretical studies have pointed out that differences in computed adsorption energies may be partially attributed to methodological issues such as pseudopotential errors and insufficient basis set convergence. It has been emphasized that the errors arising from the approximations in the XC functional can compound with numerical convergence issues, leading to an overestimation of the hollow site\u2019s stability (grinberg2002coonpt pages 4-8, carbone2024coadsorptionon pages 1-3). Notably, even more sophisticated methods such as diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) or periodic coupled cluster theory have been applied to the CO/Pt(111) system and, while they may correctly rank the sites, they still exhibit discrepancies in the absolute adsorption energy differences (carbone2024coadsorptionon pages 1-3, carbone2024coadsorptionon pages 3-5).  \n\nOverall, the computational literature reveals a complex picture: while many DFT studies based on semilocal functionals incorrectly predict a preference for hollow sites due to limitations in correctly describing the relative positions of CO\u2019s highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO\u2013LUMO) relative to the Pd Fermi level, there is increasing evidence that improvements in the XC functional and computational protocols can yield results that reconcile theory with experiment (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4).\n\nIV. DFT Methodology for Computing CO Adsorption on Pt(111)  \nThe accurate computation of CO adsorption properties on Pt(111) requires meticulous consideration of several key methodological parameters within a DFT framework. These include the choice and validation of exchange\u2013correlation functionals, the design of the slab model, k-point sampling strategies, kinetic energy cutoffs for the plane-wave basis set, and convergence criteria for both electronic and ionic relaxations. Each of these factors plays a crucial role in determining the reliability of the computed potential energy surface.\n\nA. Exchange\u2013Correlation Functionals  \nThe selection of the XC functional is perhaps the single most critical factor affecting the computed site preferences for CO adsorption. Traditional functionals such as LDA and standard GGA forms (e.g., PW91, PBE) have historically favored hollow site adsorption on Pt(111) \u2013 a result that runs counter to experimental expectations (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, kuwabara2008firstprinciplescalculation pages 2-3). More recent studies have shown that employing revised GGA forms, such as the Revised Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof (RPBE) functional, can improve the prediction of site-preference energies by reducing the over-stabilization of the hollow site (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11). Furthermore, hybrid functionals, including B3LYP as well as PBE0 and HSE03, have been investigated, with some studies indicating that these functionals tend to favor the top site, thereby bringing theoretical predictions into closer alignment with experiments (gajdo2004coadsorptionon pages 13-14, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 7-10). It is critical to note, however, that while hybrid functionals ameliorate some of the deficiencies of standard GGA approaches, they do not always fully resolve the discrepancy and may yield nearly degenerate energies between the top and other adsorption sites (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 7-10).\n\nB. Slab Models and Supercell Approaches  \nThe representation of the Pt(111) surface is customarily achieved using a periodic slab model, which must be sufficiently thick to capture the bulk-like behavior of the substrate while allowing for surface relaxation. A typical model involves a four-layer slab, with the CO molecule adsorbed on one side and the top two layers fully relaxed during geometry optimization (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7). In some studies, even five-layer slabs are employed to ensure that the deeper layers are adequately decoupled from surface relaxations. In addition, a sizable vacuum region (on the order of 15 \u00c5) must be included to eliminate spurious interactions between periodically repeated slabs (g2019adftstudy pages 5-9). It is also common to use a supercell that replicates surface features; for instance, a 3\u00d73 or larger surface cell is often chosen to simulate isolated molecule behavior at low coverages, while enabling the study of ordered overlayers at higher coverages (g2019adftstudy pages 5-9, gunasooriya2018coadsorptionon pages 6-8).\n\nC. K-Point Sampling and Brillouin Zone Integration  \nAccurate integration over the Brillouin zone is essential for reliable total energy calculations. The Monkhorst\u2013Pack scheme is widely adopted for k-point sampling in periodic systems. A typical setup for Pt(111) might involve a 5\u00d75\u00d71 grid for a 3\u00d73 surface supercell, although more rigorous studies recommend denser sampling, such as a 12\u00d712\u00d71 grid, to ensure convergence of both the total energy and the adsorption energy differences (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 7-10). The choice of k-point grid should be dictated by convergence tests, wherein the changes in total energy and forces are monitored as a function of the k-point density. Inadequate k-point sampling can lead to significant errors, particularly in metallic systems where the electronic density of states near the Fermi level is highly sensitive to the integration method.\n\nD. Energy Cutoffs and Basis-Set Convergence  \nPlane-wave DFT calculations require a cutoff energy that sets the upper limit for the plane-wave basis set. Studies investigating CO on Pt(111) typically use an energy cutoff of around 400 eV \u2013 a value that has been shown to deliver converged total energies and reliable adsorption energy differences, with an estimated accuracy of approximately 20 meV (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7). In contrast, some methods, particularly those employing pseudopotentials such as ultrasoft pseudopotentials (USP) or projector augmented-wave (PAW) potentials, might use slightly lower cutoffs (e.g., 25\u201329 Ry) when calibrated appropriately, though care must be taken to ensure that the basis set is sufficiently complete (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, g2019adftstudy pages 5-9).\n\nE. Convergence Criteria and Smearing Methods  \nThe convergence of both electronic and ionic degrees of freedom must be monitored closely. In metallic systems like Pt, a finite electronic temperature is introduced via Fermi-level smearing techniques to facilitate convergence of the electronic self-consistent field (SCF) procedure. The Methfessel\u2013Paxton smearing method is frequently employed, with a smearing width of around 0.1 eV (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7). In some studies, a slightly larger smearing value of 0.2 eV has been used; however, the sensitivity of the adsorption energies to the smearing parameter should be tested during the convergence analysis. Moreover, the convergence criterion for the total energy during ionic relaxation is typically set to a low threshold (on the order of 10^\u20135 eV) to ensure that the relaxed geometry corresponds to a true local minimum in the potential energy surface (g2019adftstudy pages 5-9, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11).\n\nF. Treatment of Surface States and Pseudopotentials  \nThe accurate representation of the Pt surface requires a careful treatment of the interaction between core and valence electrons. The projector augmented-wave (PAW) method is commonly used and has the advantage of systematically converging with respect to the plane-wave basis size (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7, gajdo2004coadsorptionon pages 13-14). The selection of the appropriate pseudopotentials and the rigorous testing of these potentials in terms of bulk properties of Pt are critical to minimizing errors due to pseudopotential approximations, which have been implicated in some of the discrepancies between different DFT studies (grinberg2002coonpt pages 4-8).\n\nV. Discussion  \nThe discrepancy between experimental and computational studies on the preferred adsorption site of CO on Pt(111) has spurred extensive research in the past two decades. Experimental evidence overwhelmingly supports the assertion that CO, at low coverages, binds predominantly via its carbon atom in a terminal, on-top position on Pt(111) surfaces. LEED, STM, and vibrational spectroscopies consistently reveal that such terminal bonding yields characteristic vibrational frequencies and ordered adsorption patterns that are in agreement with a top-site adsorption model (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, grinberg2002coonpt pages 1-4). Additionally, techniques probing adsorption energies and surface defect contributions indicate that whilst step and kink sites may initially serve as nucleation centers, terrace sites ultimately support a large population of on-top-bound CO (gauthier2001adsorptionsitesand pages 1-2, gauthier2001adsorptionsitesand pages 2-3).\n\nConversely, early computational simulations using standard DFT methods systematically favored adsorption configurations at hollow sites \u2013 a result that arises from the inherent limitations of local and semilocal XC functionals in accurately describing the subtle interplay between CO\u2019s electronic states and the d-band of Pt. The inaccuracies in predicting the relative positions of CO\u2019s HOMO and LUMO with respect to the metal Fermi level lead to an erroneous stabilization of higher coordination sites (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, kuwabara2008firstprinciplescalculation pages 2-3, grinberg2002coonpt pages 1-4). Furthermore, energy differences between the on-top and hollow sites are often very small \u2013 on the order of tens of meV \u2013 which exacerbates the sensitivity of the predictions to computational parameters such as the basis-set cutoff, k-point sampling, and slab model (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 16-20, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16).\n\nSignificant progress has been made by employing improved exchange\u2013correlation functionals. Revised GGAs, such as RPBE, and hybrid functionals, including B3LYP, PBE0, and HSE03, have been shown to mitigate some of the overbinding issues associated with the hollow sites, yielding results that are more consistent with experimental observations. For instance, calculations with hybrid functionals tend to reduce the energy difference between the atop and hollow sites, sometimes even favoring the atop site when combined with careful convergence testing (gajdo2004coadsorptionon pages 13-14, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 7-10). However, even these improved methods are not without their own challenges: discrepancies persist, and in some cases the top and hcp sites appear nearly degenerate, underscoring the need for extreme numerical diligence and systematic error analysis (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 7-10, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7).\n\nThe influence of surface coverage also plays a critical role in the site preference. At very low coverages (approximately 0.25\u20130.33 monolayers), experiments unequivocally support a top-site preference, while some computational studies indicate that the potential energy surface is highly sensitive to CO\u2013CO interactions and long-range repulsive forces. As coverage increases, additional adsorption structures emerge, including mixed overlayers with both atop and bridge sites. For example, at half-monolayer coverage (0.50 ML), an ordered structure composed of an equal mix of top and bridge adsorbates has been observed experimentally and confirmed by simulations that consider the effects of lateral interactions (gunasooriya2018coadsorptionon pages 5-6, shan2009coveragedependentcoadsorption pages 3-5). Hence, the adsorption behavior of CO on Pt(111) is not fixed but evolves with coverage, temperature, and pressure, further complicating the modeling effort.\n\nThe detailed parameters used in DFT simulations\u2014such as the slab thickness, vacuum spacing, k-point sampling, energy cutoff, smearing method, and the choice of XC functional\u2014have a profound impact on the calculated adsorption energies. For example, one study using a four-layer slab with the upper two layers relaxed, a vacuum layer of 15 \u00c5, and a kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV, combined with a Monkhorst\u2013Pack grid for k-point sampling, reported an adsorption energy accuracy of around 20 meV (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7). Similarly, other researchers have emphasized that convergence tests must be carried out systematically; even small deviations in these parameters can lead to erroneous predictions regarding the binding site preference (g2019adftstudy pages 5-9, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11).  \n\nMoreover, there is a notable interplay between the choice of XC functional and the associated pseudopotential approximation. Pseudopotential inaccuracies can compound the errors originating from the XC functional itself, particularly when simulating transition metal surfaces. For instance, discrepancies have been linked to both the pseudopotential error and the exchange\u2013correlation functional error in studies that employ traditional DFT methods (grinberg2002coonpt pages 4-8, carbone2024coadsorptionon pages 1-3). Consequently, researchers are increasingly adopting the PAW method, which offers a more systematic approach to treating core\u2013valence interactions and allows for controlled convergence by increasing the plane-wave cutoff (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7, gajdo2004coadsorptionon pages 13-14).\n\nIn summary, the long-standing \u201cCO/Pt(111) puzzle\u201d originates from a combination of experimental complexities and the intrinsic limitations of traditional DFT approaches. While experiments consistently demonstrate a top-site preference for CO adsorption under low-coverage conditions, standard DFT calculations often predict a hollow site preference due to errors in describing the electronic structure of CO and its interaction with the Pt substrate. Advances in computational methodology, including the use of revised and hybrid XC functionals as well as stringent convergence tests involving slab models, k-point meshes, and energy cutoffs, have significantly narrowed the gap between theory and experiment. However, achieving quantitative agreement remains challenging, and the subtle energetic differences underscore the need for further methodological improvements (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11).\n\nVI. Conclusion  \nIn conclusion, the combined evidence from experimental studies and computational simulations provides a comprehensive yet nuanced picture of CO adsorption on Pt(111) surfaces. Experimentally, there is robust and multidimensional evidence that, at low coverages, CO predominantly adsorbs at on-top sites, forming a well-defined overlayer that may transition into mixed configurations at higher coverages (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, grinberg2002coonpt pages 1-4). Conversely, computational approaches based on density functional theory have historically encountered challenges in reproducing this experimental trend. Standard local and semilocal functionals, such as LDA and GGA (PW91, PBE), tend to erroneously favor hollow adsorption sites, with the energy differences between atop and hollow configurations being exceptionally small\u2014on the order of 0.1\u20130.25 eV (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, kuwabara2008firstprinciplescalculation pages 2-3, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 16-20).\n\nThe emerging consensus in the computational community is that both the selection of the exchange\u2013correlation functional and the rigorous convergence of numerical parameters are critical for obtaining reliable predictions. The use of revised functionals like RPBE and hybrid functionals such as B3LYP, PBE0, and HSE03 has provided improved agreement with experiment by reducing the inherent bias toward hollow sites (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, gajdo2004coadsorptionon pages 13-14, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 7-10). Moreover, validated DFT parameters for CO adsorption on Pt(111) have been established: employing a periodic slab model (typically four or five layers with at least a 15 \u00c5 vacuum gap), using a kinetic energy cutoff of approximately 400 eV, and applying a carefully chosen Monkhorst\u2013Pack k-point mesh (ranging from 5\u00d75\u00d71 for moderate cells to 12\u00d712\u00d71 for higher accuracy) are essential steps to ensure the convergence and reliability of the results (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7, g2019adftstudy pages 5-9). Fermi-level smearing methods, such as the Methfessel\u2013Paxton technique with smearing widths around 0.1 eV, further aid in achieving electronic convergence in these metallic systems (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7).  \n\nUltimately, while the \u201cCO/Pt(111) puzzle\u201d persists in highlighting the limitations of current DFT methodologies in certain contexts, the careful calibration of computational parameters and the judicious choice of exchange\u2013correlation approximations have enabled more accurate modeling of the adsorption behavior. Such refinements are vital not only for understanding the fundamental science of CO adsorption but also for advancing the design and optimization of platinum-based catalysts in practical applications. A continued interplay between high-quality experimental measurements and rigorously validated computational simulations remains the key to resolving the discrepancies and achieving a unified description of CO adsorption on Pt(111) (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7, carbone2024coadsorptionon pages 1-3, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11).\n\nThis report, therefore, emphasizes that to compute the CO adsorption position on Pt(111) accurately using DFT, one must implement a high level of numerical and methodological rigor. The combined use of advanced exchange\u2013correlation functionals (preferably hybrid types when feasible), a well-converged periodic slab model with sufficiently large vacuum spacing and a carefully chosen supercell, together with dense k-point sampling and stringent convergence criteria, is indispensable. These best practices are now widely recommended in the literature as a pathway toward reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations, thereby addressing one of the most persistent challenges in computational surface science (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 7-10).\n\nIn summary, experimental studies unequivocally point to the atop site as the predominant adsorption position for CO on Pt(111) surfaces at low coverage, while many computational investigations based on conventional DFT methods have historically favored hollow sites due to inherent limitations in the XC approximations and methodological settings. By adhering to validated computational protocols\u2014employing hybrid or revised GGA functionals, ensuring robust k-point sampling, and utilizing well-constructed slab models with tight convergence thresholds\u2014DFT can accurately capture the potential energy landscape of CO adsorption, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of catalytic processes on platinum surfaces (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7).\n\nThe reconciliation of experimental and theoretical perspectives not only advances our fundamental knowledge of surface chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis but also provides essential guidance for future computational studies aimed at modeling similar adsorption phenomena on complex metal surfaces.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Both experimental investigations and computational simulations have reported conflicting results regarding the preferred adsorption site of CO on Pt(111). Experimentally, a variety of surface\u2010sensitive techniques, including low\u2010energy electron diffraction (LEED), infrared spectroscopy, and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), consistently indicate that CO adsorbs predominantly on top of individual Pt atoms at low coverages. In contrast, density functional theory (DFT) calculations employing standard local and semilocal exchange\u2013correlation (XC) functionals often predict that CO should favor the higher coordinated hollow or bridge sites, with energy differences on the order of tens to hundreds of meV. In addition, detailed computational studies have emphasized the sensitivity of results to the approximations used, including the choice of XC functional, the degree of numerical convergence, the slab model, k-point sampling, and the applied smearing methods. This report reviews and synthesizes the previously reported experimental results and computational findings regarding CO adsorption on Pt(111) and describes the best practices for computing this property using DFT, with an emphasis on validated guidelines for exchange\u2013correlation functionals, k-point sampling, slab models, and convergence criteria (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11).\\n\\nI. Introduction  \\nThe interaction of carbon monoxide with platinum surfaces is of paramount importance in catalysis, particularly in applications ranging from automotive exhaust treatment to fuel cell technology. Despite the widespread use of Pt-catalysts, the precise adsorption site of CO on Pt(111) remains a topic of debate due to conflicting evidence arising from experimental measurements versus theoretical predictions. Experimentally, a consensus has emerged that at low coverage, CO binds preferentially to atop sites on the Pt(111) surface, providing strong evidence from techniques such as LEED, STM, and vibrational spectroscopy (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4). However, early computational studies based on density functional theory (DFT) repeatedly favored adsorption at the threefold hollow sites, particularly the face\u2010centered cubic (fcc) hollow position, with energy differences between sites sometimes varying by 0.1\u20130.25 eV (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, kuwabara2008firstprinciplescalculation pages 2-3). This inconsistency is known as the \u201cCO/Pt(111) puzzle\u201d and highlights the extreme sensitivity of DFT results to the specific computational details employed (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16).  \\n\\nThis report critically examines the literature to clarify both the experimental observations and the computational predictions regarding the adsorption geometry of CO on Pt(111). Moreover, it aims to provide detailed guidelines for using DFT to compute the adsorption energies and geometries of CO on Pt(111), considering the validated and recommended computational parameters such as exchange-correlation functionals, k-point sampling, slab models, and convergence criteria. A high level of numerical rigor and methodological care is essential to obtain reliable and reproducible predictions that can reconcile the differences between theoretical and experimental findings (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7).\\n\\nII. Experimental Observations  \\nExperimental studies on CO adsorption on Pt(111) provide a diverse set of observations that consistently indicate a strong site preference for atop adsorption under low-pressure, low-coverage conditions. LEED investigations, for example, have shown that in structures such as the c(4\u00d72)-CO/Pt(111) overlayer, CO molecules adopt configurations in which one molecule is terminally bonded (on top) and another is in a twofold coordinated bridge geometry (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11). In these experiments, measurements indicate that approximately 88% of CO molecules are found at the atop sites, with the remaining 12% occupying bridge sites, thereby strongly supporting a terminal adsorption model (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, grinberg2002coonpt pages 1-4).  \\n\\nVibrational spectroscopy studies, including infrared absorption and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), also provide evidence in favor of atop adsorption. The characteristic C\u2013O stretching frequencies observed under ultra-high vacuum and moderate-pressure conditions are consistent with a linear, terminal bonding geometry. For instance, experiments report that the stretching frequency of on-top-bound CO shows a blue-shift as pressure increases, which is conventionally interpreted as reflecting changes in the CO\u2013Pt bond strength under different adsorption geometries (rupprechter2001highpressurecarbonmonoxide pages 1-2, rupprechter2001highpressurecarbonmonoxide pages 4-5). Additionally, high-pressure studies have confirmed that, even across a wide range of pressures (from 10^\u20137 to several hundred mbar) and temperatures (160 to 400 K), the predominant CO species is the on-top adsorbate (rupprechter2001highpressurecarbonmonoxide pages 4-5).  \\n\\nFurther evidence comes from STM measurements, which have visualized the spatial distribution of CO molecules on Pt(111), reinforcing the conclusion that at low coverages CO preferentially occupies the atop positions on flat Pt(111) terraces. These experimental findings are further reinforced by additional techniques such as x-ray photoemission spectroscopy and charge displacement experiments, which have shown that the CO adsorption energy and bonding geometry are highly sensitive to surface imperfections, with enhanced adsorption observed at defect and step-edge sites \u2013 a phenomenon that has been attributed to local ligand effects (gauthier2001adsorptionsitesand pages 1-2, gauthier2001adsorptionsitesand pages 2-3). This body of experimental evidence strongly suggests that for pristine Pt(111) surfaces under typical experimental conditions, the most stable adsorption configuration for CO is the atop site (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4).\\n\\nIII. Computational Simulations and the \u201cCO/Pt(111) Puzzle\u201d  \\nOver the past decades, computational studies based on DFT have aimed to reproduce the experimentally observed adsorption behavior of CO on Pt(111). Early DFT calculations, employing local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functionals such as PW91 and PBE, often predicted a preference for higher coordination sites, such as the threefold fcc or hcp hollow sites, over the on-top position (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, kuwabara2008firstprinciplescalculation pages 2-3). These discrepancies between theory and experiment became widely known, and the \u201cCO/Pt(111) puzzle\u201d emerged as a central problem in computational surface science (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7, grinberg2002coonpt pages 4-8).  \\n\\nSeveral details contribute to this problem. A key factor is the sensitivity of the predicted adsorption energy differences to the choice of the XC functional. For instance, while standard GGA functionals usually yield a relative stabilization of the hollow sites by as much as 0.13\u20130.24 eV, hybrid functionals such as B3LYP have been shown to favor the top site, thereby bringing theoretical predictions closer to experimental observations (gajdo2004coadsorptionon pages 13-14, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7). Nevertheless, even the use of hybrid functionals does not entirely resolve the discrepancy when applied to the Pt(111) surface; some calculations indicate that the top and hcp sites become nearly degenerate, while others still suggest that the hollow site retains a slight energetic advantage (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 7-10, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7).  \\n\\nIn addition to the XC functional, other computational factors contribute to differences in reported adsorption geometries. The size of the model used to represent the Pt(111) surface is critical: smaller cluster models tend to exaggerate the stability of the hollow site, whereas larger periodic slab models, which more accurately capture the extended electronic structure of the metal, can yield results that are more in line with experimental findings when combined with properly converged parameters (gajdo2004coadsorptionon pages 13-14, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7). For example, at low coverages of approximately 0.25 monolayers, some DFT calculations demonstrate that the binding energies for various adsorption sites are narrowly clustered, with the fcc hollow site sometimes being marginally more favorable by ~0.1 eV compared to the top site (shan2009coveragedependentcoadsorption pages 1-2). On the other hand, other simulations emphasize that a maximum adsorption stability is reached when accounting for the correct balance of through-space repulsion and charge transfer effects, indicating that an accurate description of these subtle energetic differences is essential (gunasooriya2018coadsorptionon pages 6-8, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 16-20).  \\n\\nFurthermore, theoretical studies have pointed out that differences in computed adsorption energies may be partially attributed to methodological issues such as pseudopotential errors and insufficient basis set convergence. It has been emphasized that the errors arising from the approximations in the XC functional can compound with numerical convergence issues, leading to an overestimation of the hollow site\u2019s stability (grinberg2002coonpt pages 4-8, carbone2024coadsorptionon pages 1-3). Notably, even more sophisticated methods such as diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) or periodic coupled cluster theory have been applied to the CO/Pt(111) system and, while they may correctly rank the sites, they still exhibit discrepancies in the absolute adsorption energy differences (carbone2024coadsorptionon pages 1-3, carbone2024coadsorptionon pages 3-5).  \\n\\nOverall, the computational literature reveals a complex picture: while many DFT studies based on semilocal functionals incorrectly predict a preference for hollow sites due to limitations in correctly describing the relative positions of CO\u2019s highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO\u2013LUMO) relative to the Pd Fermi level, there is increasing evidence that improvements in the XC functional and computational protocols can yield results that reconcile theory with experiment (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4).\\n\\nIV. DFT Methodology for Computing CO Adsorption on Pt(111)  \\nThe accurate computation of CO adsorption properties on Pt(111) requires meticulous consideration of several key methodological parameters within a DFT framework. These include the choice and validation of exchange\u2013correlation functionals, the design of the slab model, k-point sampling strategies, kinetic energy cutoffs for the plane-wave basis set, and convergence criteria for both electronic and ionic relaxations. Each of these factors plays a crucial role in determining the reliability of the computed potential energy surface.\\n\\nA. Exchange\u2013Correlation Functionals  \\nThe selection of the XC functional is perhaps the single most critical factor affecting the computed site preferences for CO adsorption. Traditional functionals such as LDA and standard GGA forms (e.g., PW91, PBE) have historically favored hollow site adsorption on Pt(111) \u2013 a result that runs counter to experimental expectations (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, kuwabara2008firstprinciplescalculation pages 2-3). More recent studies have shown that employing revised GGA forms, such as the Revised Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof (RPBE) functional, can improve the prediction of site-preference energies by reducing the over-stabilization of the hollow site (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11). Furthermore, hybrid functionals, including B3LYP as well as PBE0 and HSE03, have been investigated, with some studies indicating that these functionals tend to favor the top site, thereby bringing theoretical predictions into closer alignment with experiments (gajdo2004coadsorptionon pages 13-14, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 7-10). It is critical to note, however, that while hybrid functionals ameliorate some of the deficiencies of standard GGA approaches, they do not always fully resolve the discrepancy and may yield nearly degenerate energies between the top and other adsorption sites (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 7-10).\\n\\nB. Slab Models and Supercell Approaches  \\nThe representation of the Pt(111) surface is customarily achieved using a periodic slab model, which must be sufficiently thick to capture the bulk-like behavior of the substrate while allowing for surface relaxation. A typical model involves a four-layer slab, with the CO molecule adsorbed on one side and the top two layers fully relaxed during geometry optimization (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7). In some studies, even five-layer slabs are employed to ensure that the deeper layers are adequately decoupled from surface relaxations. In addition, a sizable vacuum region (on the order of 15 \u00c5) must be included to eliminate spurious interactions between periodically repeated slabs (g2019adftstudy pages 5-9). It is also common to use a supercell that replicates surface features; for instance, a 3\u00d73 or larger surface cell is often chosen to simulate isolated molecule behavior at low coverages, while enabling the study of ordered overlayers at higher coverages (g2019adftstudy pages 5-9, gunasooriya2018coadsorptionon pages 6-8).\\n\\nC. K-Point Sampling and Brillouin Zone Integration  \\nAccurate integration over the Brillouin zone is essential for reliable total energy calculations. The Monkhorst\u2013Pack scheme is widely adopted for k-point sampling in periodic systems. A typical setup for Pt(111) might involve a 5\u00d75\u00d71 grid for a 3\u00d73 surface supercell, although more rigorous studies recommend denser sampling, such as a 12\u00d712\u00d71 grid, to ensure convergence of both the total energy and the adsorption energy differences (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 7-10). The choice of k-point grid should be dictated by convergence tests, wherein the changes in total energy and forces are monitored as a function of the k-point density. Inadequate k-point sampling can lead to significant errors, particularly in metallic systems where the electronic density of states near the Fermi level is highly sensitive to the integration method.\\n\\nD. Energy Cutoffs and Basis-Set Convergence  \\nPlane-wave DFT calculations require a cutoff energy that sets the upper limit for the plane-wave basis set. Studies investigating CO on Pt(111) typically use an energy cutoff of around 400 eV \u2013 a value that has been shown to deliver converged total energies and reliable adsorption energy differences, with an estimated accuracy of approximately 20 meV (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7). In contrast, some methods, particularly those employing pseudopotentials such as ultrasoft pseudopotentials (USP) or projector augmented-wave (PAW) potentials, might use slightly lower cutoffs (e.g., 25\u201329 Ry) when calibrated appropriately, though care must be taken to ensure that the basis set is sufficiently complete (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, g2019adftstudy pages 5-9).\\n\\nE. Convergence Criteria and Smearing Methods  \\nThe convergence of both electronic and ionic degrees of freedom must be monitored closely. In metallic systems like Pt, a finite electronic temperature is introduced via Fermi-level smearing techniques to facilitate convergence of the electronic self-consistent field (SCF) procedure. The Methfessel\u2013Paxton smearing method is frequently employed, with a smearing width of around 0.1 eV (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7). In some studies, a slightly larger smearing value of 0.2 eV has been used; however, the sensitivity of the adsorption energies to the smearing parameter should be tested during the convergence analysis. Moreover, the convergence criterion for the total energy during ionic relaxation is typically set to a low threshold (on the order of 10^\u20135 eV) to ensure that the relaxed geometry corresponds to a true local minimum in the potential energy surface (g2019adftstudy pages 5-9, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11).\\n\\nF. Treatment of Surface States and Pseudopotentials  \\nThe accurate representation of the Pt surface requires a careful treatment of the interaction between core and valence electrons. The projector augmented-wave (PAW) method is commonly used and has the advantage of systematically converging with respect to the plane-wave basis size (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7, gajdo2004coadsorptionon pages 13-14). The selection of the appropriate pseudopotentials and the rigorous testing of these potentials in terms of bulk properties of Pt are critical to minimizing errors due to pseudopotential approximations, which have been implicated in some of the discrepancies between different DFT studies (grinberg2002coonpt pages 4-8).\\n\\nV. Discussion  \\nThe discrepancy between experimental and computational studies on the preferred adsorption site of CO on Pt(111) has spurred extensive research in the past two decades. Experimental evidence overwhelmingly supports the assertion that CO, at low coverages, binds predominantly via its carbon atom in a terminal, on-top position on Pt(111) surfaces. LEED, STM, and vibrational spectroscopies consistently reveal that such terminal bonding yields characteristic vibrational frequencies and ordered adsorption patterns that are in agreement with a top-site adsorption model (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, grinberg2002coonpt pages 1-4). Additionally, techniques probing adsorption energies and surface defect contributions indicate that whilst step and kink sites may initially serve as nucleation centers, terrace sites ultimately support a large population of on-top-bound CO (gauthier2001adsorptionsitesand pages 1-2, gauthier2001adsorptionsitesand pages 2-3).\\n\\nConversely, early computational simulations using standard DFT methods systematically favored adsorption configurations at hollow sites \u2013 a result that arises from the inherent limitations of local and semilocal XC functionals in accurately describing the subtle interplay between CO\u2019s electronic states and the d-band of Pt. The inaccuracies in predicting the relative positions of CO\u2019s HOMO and LUMO with respect to the metal Fermi level lead to an erroneous stabilization of higher coordination sites (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, kuwabara2008firstprinciplescalculation pages 2-3, grinberg2002coonpt pages 1-4). Furthermore, energy differences between the on-top and hollow sites are often very small \u2013 on the order of tens of meV \u2013 which exacerbates the sensitivity of the predictions to computational parameters such as the basis-set cutoff, k-point sampling, and slab model (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 16-20, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16).\\n\\nSignificant progress has been made by employing improved exchange\u2013correlation functionals. Revised GGAs, such as RPBE, and hybrid functionals, including B3LYP, PBE0, and HSE03, have been shown to mitigate some of the overbinding issues associated with the hollow sites, yielding results that are more consistent with experimental observations. For instance, calculations with hybrid functionals tend to reduce the energy difference between the atop and hollow sites, sometimes even favoring the atop site when combined with careful convergence testing (gajdo2004coadsorptionon pages 13-14, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 7-10). However, even these improved methods are not without their own challenges: discrepancies persist, and in some cases the top and hcp sites appear nearly degenerate, underscoring the need for extreme numerical diligence and systematic error analysis (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 7-10, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7).\\n\\nThe influence of surface coverage also plays a critical role in the site preference. At very low coverages (approximately 0.25\u20130.33 monolayers), experiments unequivocally support a top-site preference, while some computational studies indicate that the potential energy surface is highly sensitive to CO\u2013CO interactions and long-range repulsive forces. As coverage increases, additional adsorption structures emerge, including mixed overlayers with both atop and bridge sites. For example, at half-monolayer coverage (0.50 ML), an ordered structure composed of an equal mix of top and bridge adsorbates has been observed experimentally and confirmed by simulations that consider the effects of lateral interactions (gunasooriya2018coadsorptionon pages 5-6, shan2009coveragedependentcoadsorption pages 3-5). Hence, the adsorption behavior of CO on Pt(111) is not fixed but evolves with coverage, temperature, and pressure, further complicating the modeling effort.\\n\\nThe detailed parameters used in DFT simulations\u2014such as the slab thickness, vacuum spacing, k-point sampling, energy cutoff, smearing method, and the choice of XC functional\u2014have a profound impact on the calculated adsorption energies. For example, one study using a four-layer slab with the upper two layers relaxed, a vacuum layer of 15 \u00c5, and a kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV, combined with a Monkhorst\u2013Pack grid for k-point sampling, reported an adsorption energy accuracy of around 20 meV (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7). Similarly, other researchers have emphasized that convergence tests must be carried out systematically; even small deviations in these parameters can lead to erroneous predictions regarding the binding site preference (g2019adftstudy pages 5-9, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11).  \\n\\nMoreover, there is a notable interplay between the choice of XC functional and the associated pseudopotential approximation. Pseudopotential inaccuracies can compound the errors originating from the XC functional itself, particularly when simulating transition metal surfaces. For instance, discrepancies have been linked to both the pseudopotential error and the exchange\u2013correlation functional error in studies that employ traditional DFT methods (grinberg2002coonpt pages 4-8, carbone2024coadsorptionon pages 1-3). Consequently, researchers are increasingly adopting the PAW method, which offers a more systematic approach to treating core\u2013valence interactions and allows for controlled convergence by increasing the plane-wave cutoff (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7, gajdo2004coadsorptionon pages 13-14).\\n\\nIn summary, the long-standing \u201cCO/Pt(111) puzzle\u201d originates from a combination of experimental complexities and the intrinsic limitations of traditional DFT approaches. While experiments consistently demonstrate a top-site preference for CO adsorption under low-coverage conditions, standard DFT calculations often predict a hollow site preference due to errors in describing the electronic structure of CO and its interaction with the Pt substrate. Advances in computational methodology, including the use of revised and hybrid XC functionals as well as stringent convergence tests involving slab models, k-point meshes, and energy cutoffs, have significantly narrowed the gap between theory and experiment. However, achieving quantitative agreement remains challenging, and the subtle energetic differences underscore the need for further methodological improvements (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11).\\n\\nVI. Conclusion  \\nIn conclusion, the combined evidence from experimental studies and computational simulations provides a comprehensive yet nuanced picture of CO adsorption on Pt(111) surfaces. Experimentally, there is robust and multidimensional evidence that, at low coverages, CO predominantly adsorbs at on-top sites, forming a well-defined overlayer that may transition into mixed configurations at higher coverages (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, grinberg2002coonpt pages 1-4). Conversely, computational approaches based on density functional theory have historically encountered challenges in reproducing this experimental trend. Standard local and semilocal functionals, such as LDA and GGA (PW91, PBE), tend to erroneously favor hollow adsorption sites, with the energy differences between atop and hollow configurations being exceptionally small\u2014on the order of 0.1\u20130.25 eV (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, kuwabara2008firstprinciplescalculation pages 2-3, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 16-20).\\n\\nThe emerging consensus in the computational community is that both the selection of the exchange\u2013correlation functional and the rigorous convergence of numerical parameters are critical for obtaining reliable predictions. The use of revised functionals like RPBE and hybrid functionals such as B3LYP, PBE0, and HSE03 has provided improved agreement with experiment by reducing the inherent bias toward hollow sites (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, gajdo2004coadsorptionon pages 13-14, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 7-10). Moreover, validated DFT parameters for CO adsorption on Pt(111) have been established: employing a periodic slab model (typically four or five layers with at least a 15 \u00c5 vacuum gap), using a kinetic energy cutoff of approximately 400 eV, and applying a carefully chosen Monkhorst\u2013Pack k-point mesh (ranging from 5\u00d75\u00d71 for moderate cells to 12\u00d712\u00d71 for higher accuracy) are essential steps to ensure the convergence and reliability of the results (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7, g2019adftstudy pages 5-9). Fermi-level smearing methods, such as the Methfessel\u2013Paxton technique with smearing widths around 0.1 eV, further aid in achieving electronic convergence in these metallic systems (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7).  \\n\\nUltimately, while the \u201cCO/Pt(111) puzzle\u201d persists in highlighting the limitations of current DFT methodologies in certain contexts, the careful calibration of computational parameters and the judicious choice of exchange\u2013correlation approximations have enabled more accurate modeling of the adsorption behavior. Such refinements are vital not only for understanding the fundamental science of CO adsorption but also for advancing the design and optimization of platinum-based catalysts in practical applications. A continued interplay between high-quality experimental measurements and rigorously validated computational simulations remains the key to resolving the discrepancies and achieving a unified description of CO adsorption on Pt(111) (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7, carbone2024coadsorptionon pages 1-3, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11).\\n\\nThis report, therefore, emphasizes that to compute the CO adsorption position on Pt(111) accurately using DFT, one must implement a high level of numerical and methodological rigor. The combined use of advanced exchange\u2013correlation functionals (preferably hybrid types when feasible), a well-converged periodic slab model with sufficiently large vacuum spacing and a carefully chosen supercell, together with dense k-point sampling and stringent convergence criteria, is indispensable. These best practices are now widely recommended in the literature as a pathway toward reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations, thereby addressing one of the most persistent challenges in computational surface science (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 7-10).\\n\\nIn summary, experimental studies unequivocally point to the atop site as the predominant adsorption position for CO on Pt(111) surfaces at low coverage, while many computational investigations based on conventional DFT methods have historically favored hollow sites due to inherent limitations in the XC approximations and methodological settings. By adhering to validated computational protocols\u2014employing hybrid or revised GGA functionals, ensuring robust k-point sampling, and utilizing well-constructed slab models with tight convergence thresholds\u2014DFT can accurately capture the potential energy landscape of CO adsorption, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of catalytic processes on platinum surfaces (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7).\\n\\nThe reconciliation of experimental and theoretical perspectives not only advances our fundamental knowledge of surface chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis but also provides essential guidance for future computational studies aimed at modeling similar adsorption phenomena on complex metal surfaces.\",\"formatted_answer\":\"Question: What are the previously reported results from both experimental studies and computational simulations regarding the adsorption position of CO on Pt(111) surfaces, and how can this property be computed using density functional theory (DFT), including details on validated and recommended DFT parameters such as exchange-correlation functionals, k-point sampling, slab models, and convergence criteria?\\n\\nAbstract\u2014The adsorption of carbon monoxide (CO) on platinum (111) surfaces is one of the most studied systems in surface science and heterogeneous catalysis, yet it presents a long\u2010standing puzzle. Both experimental investigations and computational simulations have reported conflicting results regarding the preferred adsorption site of CO on Pt(111). Experimentally, a variety of surface\u2010sensitive techniques, including low\u2010energy electron diffraction (LEED), infrared spectroscopy, and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), consistently indicate that CO adsorbs predominantly on top of individual Pt atoms at low coverages. In contrast, density functional theory (DFT) calculations employing standard local and semilocal exchange\u2013correlation (XC) functionals often predict that CO should favor the higher coordinated hollow or bridge sites, with energy differences on the order of tens to hundreds of meV. In addition, detailed computational studies have emphasized the sensitivity of results to the approximations used, including the choice of XC functional, the degree of numerical convergence, the slab model, k-point sampling, and the applied smearing methods. This report reviews and synthesizes the previously reported experimental results and computational findings regarding CO adsorption on Pt(111) and describes the best practices for computing this property using DFT, with an emphasis on validated guidelines for exchange\u2013correlation functionals, k-point sampling, slab models, and convergence criteria (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11).\\n\\nI. Introduction  \\nThe interaction of carbon monoxide with platinum surfaces is of paramount importance in catalysis, particularly in applications ranging from automotive exhaust treatment to fuel cell technology. Despite the widespread use of Pt-catalysts, the precise adsorption site of CO on Pt(111) remains a topic of debate due to conflicting evidence arising from experimental measurements versus theoretical predictions. Experimentally, a consensus has emerged that at low coverage, CO binds preferentially to atop sites on the Pt(111) surface, providing strong evidence from techniques such as LEED, STM, and vibrational spectroscopy (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4). However, early computational studies based on density functional theory (DFT) repeatedly favored adsorption at the threefold hollow sites, particularly the face\u2010centered cubic (fcc) hollow position, with energy differences between sites sometimes varying by 0.1\u20130.25 eV (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, kuwabara2008firstprinciplescalculation pages 2-3). This inconsistency is known as the \u201cCO/Pt(111) puzzle\u201d and highlights the extreme sensitivity of DFT results to the specific computational details employed (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16).  \\n\\nThis report critically examines the literature to clarify both the experimental observations and the computational predictions regarding the adsorption geometry of CO on Pt(111). Moreover, it aims to provide detailed guidelines for using DFT to compute the adsorption energies and geometries of CO on Pt(111), considering the validated and recommended computational parameters such as exchange-correlation functionals, k-point sampling, slab models, and convergence criteria. A high level of numerical rigor and methodological care is essential to obtain reliable and reproducible predictions that can reconcile the differences between theoretical and experimental findings (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7).\\n\\nII. Experimental Observations  \\nExperimental studies on CO adsorption on Pt(111) provide a diverse set of observations that consistently indicate a strong site preference for atop adsorption under low-pressure, low-coverage conditions. LEED investigations, for example, have shown that in structures such as the c(4\u00d72)-CO/Pt(111) overlayer, CO molecules adopt configurations in which one molecule is terminally bonded (on top) and another is in a twofold coordinated bridge geometry (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11). In these experiments, measurements indicate that approximately 88% of CO molecules are found at the atop sites, with the remaining 12% occupying bridge sites, thereby strongly supporting a terminal adsorption model (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, grinberg2002coonpt pages 1-4).  \\n\\nVibrational spectroscopy studies, including infrared absorption and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), also provide evidence in favor of atop adsorption. The characteristic C\u2013O stretching frequencies observed under ultra-high vacuum and moderate-pressure conditions are consistent with a linear, terminal bonding geometry. For instance, experiments report that the stretching frequency of on-top-bound CO shows a blue-shift as pressure increases, which is conventionally interpreted as reflecting changes in the CO\u2013Pt bond strength under different adsorption geometries (rupprechter2001highpressurecarbonmonoxide pages 1-2, rupprechter2001highpressurecarbonmonoxide pages 4-5). Additionally, high-pressure studies have confirmed that, even across a wide range of pressures (from 10^\u20137 to several hundred mbar) and temperatures (160 to 400 K), the predominant CO species is the on-top adsorbate (rupprechter2001highpressurecarbonmonoxide pages 4-5).  \\n\\nFurther evidence comes from STM measurements, which have visualized the spatial distribution of CO molecules on Pt(111), reinforcing the conclusion that at low coverages CO preferentially occupies the atop positions on flat Pt(111) terraces. These experimental findings are further reinforced by additional techniques such as x-ray photoemission spectroscopy and charge displacement experiments, which have shown that the CO adsorption energy and bonding geometry are highly sensitive to surface imperfections, with enhanced adsorption observed at defect and step-edge sites \u2013 a phenomenon that has been attributed to local ligand effects (gauthier2001adsorptionsitesand pages 1-2, gauthier2001adsorptionsitesand pages 2-3). This body of experimental evidence strongly suggests that for pristine Pt(111) surfaces under typical experimental conditions, the most stable adsorption configuration for CO is the atop site (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4).\\n\\nIII. Computational Simulations and the \u201cCO/Pt(111) Puzzle\u201d  \\nOver the past decades, computational studies based on DFT have aimed to reproduce the experimentally observed adsorption behavior of CO on Pt(111). Early DFT calculations, employing local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functionals such as PW91 and PBE, often predicted a preference for higher coordination sites, such as the threefold fcc or hcp hollow sites, over the on-top position (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, kuwabara2008firstprinciplescalculation pages 2-3). These discrepancies between theory and experiment became widely known, and the \u201cCO/Pt(111) puzzle\u201d emerged as a central problem in computational surface science (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7, grinberg2002coonpt pages 4-8).  \\n\\nSeveral details contribute to this problem. A key factor is the sensitivity of the predicted adsorption energy differences to the choice of the XC functional. For instance, while standard GGA functionals usually yield a relative stabilization of the hollow sites by as much as 0.13\u20130.24 eV, hybrid functionals such as B3LYP have been shown to favor the top site, thereby bringing theoretical predictions closer to experimental observations (gajdo2004coadsorptionon pages 13-14, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7). Nevertheless, even the use of hybrid functionals does not entirely resolve the discrepancy when applied to the Pt(111) surface; some calculations indicate that the top and hcp sites become nearly degenerate, while others still suggest that the hollow site retains a slight energetic advantage (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 7-10, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7).  \\n\\nIn addition to the XC functional, other computational factors contribute to differences in reported adsorption geometries. The size of the model used to represent the Pt(111) surface is critical: smaller cluster models tend to exaggerate the stability of the hollow site, whereas larger periodic slab models, which more accurately capture the extended electronic structure of the metal, can yield results that are more in line with experimental findings when combined with properly converged parameters (gajdo2004coadsorptionon pages 13-14, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7). For example, at low coverages of approximately 0.25 monolayers, some DFT calculations demonstrate that the binding energies for various adsorption sites are narrowly clustered, with the fcc hollow site sometimes being marginally more favorable by ~0.1 eV compared to the top site (shan2009coveragedependentcoadsorption pages 1-2). On the other hand, other simulations emphasize that a maximum adsorption stability is reached when accounting for the correct balance of through-space repulsion and charge transfer effects, indicating that an accurate description of these subtle energetic differences is essential (gunasooriya2018coadsorptionon pages 6-8, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 16-20).  \\n\\nFurthermore, theoretical studies have pointed out that differences in computed adsorption energies may be partially attributed to methodological issues such as pseudopotential errors and insufficient basis set convergence. It has been emphasized that the errors arising from the approximations in the XC functional can compound with numerical convergence issues, leading to an overestimation of the hollow site\u2019s stability (grinberg2002coonpt pages 4-8, carbone2024coadsorptionon pages 1-3). Notably, even more sophisticated methods such as diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) or periodic coupled cluster theory have been applied to the CO/Pt(111) system and, while they may correctly rank the sites, they still exhibit discrepancies in the absolute adsorption energy differences (carbone2024coadsorptionon pages 1-3, carbone2024coadsorptionon pages 3-5).  \\n\\nOverall, the computational literature reveals a complex picture: while many DFT studies based on semilocal functionals incorrectly predict a preference for hollow sites due to limitations in correctly describing the relative positions of CO\u2019s highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO\u2013LUMO) relative to the Pd Fermi level, there is increasing evidence that improvements in the XC functional and computational protocols can yield results that reconcile theory with experiment (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4).\\n\\nIV. DFT Methodology for Computing CO Adsorption on Pt(111)  \\nThe accurate computation of CO adsorption properties on Pt(111) requires meticulous consideration of several key methodological parameters within a DFT framework. These include the choice and validation of exchange\u2013correlation functionals, the design of the slab model, k-point sampling strategies, kinetic energy cutoffs for the plane-wave basis set, and convergence criteria for both electronic and ionic relaxations. Each of these factors plays a crucial role in determining the reliability of the computed potential energy surface.\\n\\nA. Exchange\u2013Correlation Functionals  \\nThe selection of the XC functional is perhaps the single most critical factor affecting the computed site preferences for CO adsorption. Traditional functionals such as LDA and standard GGA forms (e.g., PW91, PBE) have historically favored hollow site adsorption on Pt(111) \u2013 a result that runs counter to experimental expectations (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, kuwabara2008firstprinciplescalculation pages 2-3). More recent studies have shown that employing revised GGA forms, such as the Revised Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof (RPBE) functional, can improve the prediction of site-preference energies by reducing the over-stabilization of the hollow site (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11). Furthermore, hybrid functionals, including B3LYP as well as PBE0 and HSE03, have been investigated, with some studies indicating that these functionals tend to favor the top site, thereby bringing theoretical predictions into closer alignment with experiments (gajdo2004coadsorptionon pages 13-14, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 7-10). It is critical to note, however, that while hybrid functionals ameliorate some of the deficiencies of standard GGA approaches, they do not always fully resolve the discrepancy and may yield nearly degenerate energies between the top and other adsorption sites (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 7-10).\\n\\nB. Slab Models and Supercell Approaches  \\nThe representation of the Pt(111) surface is customarily achieved using a periodic slab model, which must be sufficiently thick to capture the bulk-like behavior of the substrate while allowing for surface relaxation. A typical model involves a four-layer slab, with the CO molecule adsorbed on one side and the top two layers fully relaxed during geometry optimization (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7). In some studies, even five-layer slabs are employed to ensure that the deeper layers are adequately decoupled from surface relaxations. In addition, a sizable vacuum region (on the order of 15 \u00c5) must be included to eliminate spurious interactions between periodically repeated slabs (g2019adftstudy pages 5-9). It is also common to use a supercell that replicates surface features; for instance, a 3\u00d73 or larger surface cell is often chosen to simulate isolated molecule behavior at low coverages, while enabling the study of ordered overlayers at higher coverages (g2019adftstudy pages 5-9, gunasooriya2018coadsorptionon pages 6-8).\\n\\nC. K-Point Sampling and Brillouin Zone Integration  \\nAccurate integration over the Brillouin zone is essential for reliable total energy calculations. The Monkhorst\u2013Pack scheme is widely adopted for k-point sampling in periodic systems. A typical setup for Pt(111) might involve a 5\u00d75\u00d71 grid for a 3\u00d73 surface supercell, although more rigorous studies recommend denser sampling, such as a 12\u00d712\u00d71 grid, to ensure convergence of both the total energy and the adsorption energy differences (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 7-10). The choice of k-point grid should be dictated by convergence tests, wherein the changes in total energy and forces are monitored as a function of the k-point density. Inadequate k-point sampling can lead to significant errors, particularly in metallic systems where the electronic density of states near the Fermi level is highly sensitive to the integration method.\\n\\nD. Energy Cutoffs and Basis-Set Convergence  \\nPlane-wave DFT calculations require a cutoff energy that sets the upper limit for the plane-wave basis set. Studies investigating CO on Pt(111) typically use an energy cutoff of around 400 eV \u2013 a value that has been shown to deliver converged total energies and reliable adsorption energy differences, with an estimated accuracy of approximately 20 meV (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7). In contrast, some methods, particularly those employing pseudopotentials such as ultrasoft pseudopotentials (USP) or projector augmented-wave (PAW) potentials, might use slightly lower cutoffs (e.g., 25\u201329 Ry) when calibrated appropriately, though care must be taken to ensure that the basis set is sufficiently complete (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, g2019adftstudy pages 5-9).\\n\\nE. Convergence Criteria and Smearing Methods  \\nThe convergence of both electronic and ionic degrees of freedom must be monitored closely. In metallic systems like Pt, a finite electronic temperature is introduced via Fermi-level smearing techniques to facilitate convergence of the electronic self-consistent field (SCF) procedure. The Methfessel\u2013Paxton smearing method is frequently employed, with a smearing width of around 0.1 eV (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7). In some studies, a slightly larger smearing value of 0.2 eV has been used; however, the sensitivity of the adsorption energies to the smearing parameter should be tested during the convergence analysis. Moreover, the convergence criterion for the total energy during ionic relaxation is typically set to a low threshold (on the order of 10^\u20135 eV) to ensure that the relaxed geometry corresponds to a true local minimum in the potential energy surface (g2019adftstudy pages 5-9, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11).\\n\\nF. Treatment of Surface States and Pseudopotentials  \\nThe accurate representation of the Pt surface requires a careful treatment of the interaction between core and valence electrons. The projector augmented-wave (PAW) method is commonly used and has the advantage of systematically converging with respect to the plane-wave basis size (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7, gajdo2004coadsorptionon pages 13-14). The selection of the appropriate pseudopotentials and the rigorous testing of these potentials in terms of bulk properties of Pt are critical to minimizing errors due to pseudopotential approximations, which have been implicated in some of the discrepancies between different DFT studies (grinberg2002coonpt pages 4-8).\\n\\nV. Discussion  \\nThe discrepancy between experimental and computational studies on the preferred adsorption site of CO on Pt(111) has spurred extensive research in the past two decades. Experimental evidence overwhelmingly supports the assertion that CO, at low coverages, binds predominantly via its carbon atom in a terminal, on-top position on Pt(111) surfaces. LEED, STM, and vibrational spectroscopies consistently reveal that such terminal bonding yields characteristic vibrational frequencies and ordered adsorption patterns that are in agreement with a top-site adsorption model (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, grinberg2002coonpt pages 1-4). Additionally, techniques probing adsorption energies and surface defect contributions indicate that whilst step and kink sites may initially serve as nucleation centers, terrace sites ultimately support a large population of on-top-bound CO (gauthier2001adsorptionsitesand pages 1-2, gauthier2001adsorptionsitesand pages 2-3).\\n\\nConversely, early computational simulations using standard DFT methods systematically favored adsorption configurations at hollow sites \u2013 a result that arises from the inherent limitations of local and semilocal XC functionals in accurately describing the subtle interplay between CO\u2019s electronic states and the d-band of Pt. The inaccuracies in predicting the relative positions of CO\u2019s HOMO and LUMO with respect to the metal Fermi level lead to an erroneous stabilization of higher coordination sites (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, kuwabara2008firstprinciplescalculation pages 2-3, grinberg2002coonpt pages 1-4). Furthermore, energy differences between the on-top and hollow sites are often very small \u2013 on the order of tens of meV \u2013 which exacerbates the sensitivity of the predictions to computational parameters such as the basis-set cutoff, k-point sampling, and slab model (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 16-20, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16).\\n\\nSignificant progress has been made by employing improved exchange\u2013correlation functionals. Revised GGAs, such as RPBE, and hybrid functionals, including B3LYP, PBE0, and HSE03, have been shown to mitigate some of the overbinding issues associated with the hollow sites, yielding results that are more consistent with experimental observations. For instance, calculations with hybrid functionals tend to reduce the energy difference between the atop and hollow sites, sometimes even favoring the atop site when combined with careful convergence testing (gajdo2004coadsorptionon pages 13-14, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 7-10). However, even these improved methods are not without their own challenges: discrepancies persist, and in some cases the top and hcp sites appear nearly degenerate, underscoring the need for extreme numerical diligence and systematic error analysis (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 7-10, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7).\\n\\nThe influence of surface coverage also plays a critical role in the site preference. At very low coverages (approximately 0.25\u20130.33 monolayers), experiments unequivocally support a top-site preference, while some computational studies indicate that the potential energy surface is highly sensitive to CO\u2013CO interactions and long-range repulsive forces. As coverage increases, additional adsorption structures emerge, including mixed overlayers with both atop and bridge sites. For example, at half-monolayer coverage (0.50 ML), an ordered structure composed of an equal mix of top and bridge adsorbates has been observed experimentally and confirmed by simulations that consider the effects of lateral interactions (gunasooriya2018coadsorptionon pages 5-6, shan2009coveragedependentcoadsorption pages 3-5). Hence, the adsorption behavior of CO on Pt(111) is not fixed but evolves with coverage, temperature, and pressure, further complicating the modeling effort.\\n\\nThe detailed parameters used in DFT simulations\u2014such as the slab thickness, vacuum spacing, k-point sampling, energy cutoff, smearing method, and the choice of XC functional\u2014have a profound impact on the calculated adsorption energies. For example, one study using a four-layer slab with the upper two layers relaxed, a vacuum layer of 15 \u00c5, and a kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV, combined with a Monkhorst\u2013Pack grid for k-point sampling, reported an adsorption energy accuracy of around 20 meV (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7). Similarly, other researchers have emphasized that convergence tests must be carried out systematically; even small deviations in these parameters can lead to erroneous predictions regarding the binding site preference (g2019adftstudy pages 5-9, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11).  \\n\\nMoreover, there is a notable interplay between the choice of XC functional and the associated pseudopotential approximation. Pseudopotential inaccuracies can compound the errors originating from the XC functional itself, particularly when simulating transition metal surfaces. For instance, discrepancies have been linked to both the pseudopotential error and the exchange\u2013correlation functional error in studies that employ traditional DFT methods (grinberg2002coonpt pages 4-8, carbone2024coadsorptionon pages 1-3). Consequently, researchers are increasingly adopting the PAW method, which offers a more systematic approach to treating core\u2013valence interactions and allows for controlled convergence by increasing the plane-wave cutoff (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7, gajdo2004coadsorptionon pages 13-14).\\n\\nIn summary, the long-standing \u201cCO/Pt(111) puzzle\u201d originates from a combination of experimental complexities and the intrinsic limitations of traditional DFT approaches. While experiments consistently demonstrate a top-site preference for CO adsorption under low-coverage conditions, standard DFT calculations often predict a hollow site preference due to errors in describing the electronic structure of CO and its interaction with the Pt substrate. Advances in computational methodology, including the use of revised and hybrid XC functionals as well as stringent convergence tests involving slab models, k-point meshes, and energy cutoffs, have significantly narrowed the gap between theory and experiment. However, achieving quantitative agreement remains challenging, and the subtle energetic differences underscore the need for further methodological improvements (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11).\\n\\nVI. Conclusion  \\nIn conclusion, the combined evidence from experimental studies and computational simulations provides a comprehensive yet nuanced picture of CO adsorption on Pt(111) surfaces. Experimentally, there is robust and multidimensional evidence that, at low coverages, CO predominantly adsorbs at on-top sites, forming a well-defined overlayer that may transition into mixed configurations at higher coverages (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, grinberg2002coonpt pages 1-4). Conversely, computational approaches based on density functional theory have historically encountered challenges in reproducing this experimental trend. Standard local and semilocal functionals, such as LDA and GGA (PW91, PBE), tend to erroneously favor hollow adsorption sites, with the energy differences between atop and hollow configurations being exceptionally small\u2014on the order of 0.1\u20130.25 eV (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, kuwabara2008firstprinciplescalculation pages 2-3, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 16-20).\\n\\nThe emerging consensus in the computational community is that both the selection of the exchange\u2013correlation functional and the rigorous convergence of numerical parameters are critical for obtaining reliable predictions. The use of revised functionals like RPBE and hybrid functionals such as B3LYP, PBE0, and HSE03 has provided improved agreement with experiment by reducing the inherent bias toward hollow sites (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, gajdo2004coadsorptionon pages 13-14, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 7-10). Moreover, validated DFT parameters for CO adsorption on Pt(111) have been established: employing a periodic slab model (typically four or five layers with at least a 15 \u00c5 vacuum gap), using a kinetic energy cutoff of approximately 400 eV, and applying a carefully chosen Monkhorst\u2013Pack k-point mesh (ranging from 5\u00d75\u00d71 for moderate cells to 12\u00d712\u00d71 for higher accuracy) are essential steps to ensure the convergence and reliability of the results (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7, g2019adftstudy pages 5-9). Fermi-level smearing methods, such as the Methfessel\u2013Paxton technique with smearing widths around 0.1 eV, further aid in achieving electronic convergence in these metallic systems (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7).  \\n\\nUltimately, while the \u201cCO/Pt(111) puzzle\u201d persists in highlighting the limitations of current DFT methodologies in certain contexts, the careful calibration of computational parameters and the judicious choice of exchange\u2013correlation approximations have enabled more accurate modeling of the adsorption behavior. Such refinements are vital not only for understanding the fundamental science of CO adsorption but also for advancing the design and optimization of platinum-based catalysts in practical applications. A continued interplay between high-quality experimental measurements and rigorously validated computational simulations remains the key to resolving the discrepancies and achieving a unified description of CO adsorption on Pt(111) (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7, carbone2024coadsorptionon pages 1-3, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11).\\n\\nThis report, therefore, emphasizes that to compute the CO adsorption position on Pt(111) accurately using DFT, one must implement a high level of numerical and methodological rigor. The combined use of advanced exchange\u2013correlation functionals (preferably hybrid types when feasible), a well-converged periodic slab model with sufficiently large vacuum spacing and a carefully chosen supercell, together with dense k-point sampling and stringent convergence criteria, is indispensable. These best practices are now widely recommended in the literature as a pathway toward reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations, thereby addressing one of the most persistent challenges in computational surface science (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 7-10).\\n\\nIn summary, experimental studies unequivocally point to the atop site as the predominant adsorption position for CO on Pt(111) surfaces at low coverage, while many computational investigations based on conventional DFT methods have historically favored hollow sites due to inherent limitations in the XC approximations and methodological settings. By adhering to validated computational protocols\u2014employing hybrid or revised GGA functionals, ensuring robust k-point sampling, and utilizing well-constructed slab models with tight convergence thresholds\u2014DFT can accurately capture the potential energy landscape of CO adsorption, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of catalytic processes on platinum surfaces (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7).\\n\\nThe reconciliation of experimental and theoretical perspectives not only advances our fundamental knowledge of surface chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis but also provides essential guidance for future computational studies aimed at modeling similar adsorption phenomena on complex metal surfaces.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

    "formatted_answer": "Question: What are the previously reported results from both experimental studies and computational simulations regarding the preferred adsorption site of CO on Pt(111) surfaces? Additionally, how can this adsorption preference be computed using density functional theory (DFT), including which DFT functionals, pseudopotentials, k-point meshes, slab models, and other computational parameters have been validated and are recommended for accurately modeling CO adsorption on Pt(111)?\n\nI. Introduction  \nCarbon monoxide (CO) adsorption on platinum (Pt(111)) surfaces has been intensively studied over the past decades owing to its importance in catalysis and surface science. Both experimental measurements and computational simulations have yielded valuable, albeit sometimes contradictory, insights regarding the preferred adsorption site of CO on Pt(111). This report summarizes the previously reported experimental observations and computational predictions, while also delineating the state\u2010of\u2010the-art density functional theory (DFT) methodologies that have been validated for modeling this system. The discussion emphasizes the nuances of the adsorption energy landscape, the sensitivity of computed site preferences to the choice of exchange\u2013correlation functionals and computational parameters, and the continuing challenges that give rise to what is commonly referred to as the \u201cCO/Pt(111) puzzle\u201d (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16).\n\nII. Experimental Observations on CO Adsorption Sites  \nExperimental studies consistently indicate that, at low coverages, CO preferentially adsorbs at the top (on\u2010top) sites of the Pt(111) surface. Techniques such as low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), infrared spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and electron-energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) have revealed a dominant occupancy of atop sites under ultra-high vacuum conditions. For instance, LEED investigations identified ordered patterns in which, under a coverage of approximately one-third of a monolayer (ML), the majority of CO molecules occupy top sites, with minor contributions from bridge geometries at higher coverages (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4). Infrared absorption measurements have consistently reported peaks near 2090\u20132100 cm\u207b\u00b9, which are characteristic of CO molecules bonded perpendicular to the surface at top sites and provide further strong evidence of atop adsorption (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 7-10, gunasooriya2018coadsorptionsite pages 1-2). Additional experimental work has shown that for a half-monolayer, CO can form well-ordered structures\u2014for example, a c(4 \u00d7 2)-CO/Pt(111) arrangement in which one molecule is adsorbed at an atop site and another at a bridge site\u2014which underscores that while atop adsorption dominates, there can be a coexistence or transition to mixed configurations depending on the coverage and environmental conditions (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 16-20, sumaria2020optimalpackingof pages 12-15). Temperature-programmed desorption and other surface-sensitive techniques have quantified the chemisorption energy and indicated relatively small energy differences (on the order of 4\u20135 kJ/mol) between top and bridge sites, reinforcing the notion that even if the atop site is predominant, slight energetic competition exists at different coverages (grinberg2002coonpt pages 1-4, gunasooriya2018coadsorptionon pages 2-3). In summary, the experimental consensus is that at low CO coverage under controlled temperatures and pressures, the CO molecules are predominantly adsorbed on top sites, with any secondary contributions from bridge sites manifesting primarily at higher coverages or under particular adsorption conditions (sumaria2020optimalpackingof pages 15-18, patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 10-12).\n\nIII. Computational Simulations Using Density Functional Theory  \nIn parallel with experimental efforts, computational investigations employing DFT have strived to elucidate the preferential adsorption site of CO on Pt(111). However, longstanding challenges have emerged because the results heavily depend on the specific approximations and computational parameters used. Early DFT studies often reported conflicting predictions, with several investigations favoring high-coordination sites such as the face-centered cubic (fcc) or hexagonal close-packed (hcp) hollow sites over the atop site\u2014a result in stark contrast to experimental observations (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4, grinberg2002coonpt pages 1-4). For example, several studies using generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functionals such as PW91 or PBE have predicted a site hierarchy in which the fcc hollow site is energetically most favorable, followed by hcp hollow, bridge, and finally top sites (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 4-7, janthon2017addingpiecesto pages 10-18). These discrepancies have been attributed to the sensitivity of CO adsorption energetics to the treatment of metal\u2013adsorbate interactions and to the shortcomings in capturing the proper energy differences associated with different bonding configurations, often linked to an underestimation of the HOMO\u2013LUMO gap of CO (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7, sumaria2020optimalpackingof pages 4-8).  \n\nSome computational studies have employed scalar relativistic corrections that underscore the importance of relativistic effects in Pt, and several works incorporating these effects with non-local or hybrid functionals suggest a shift in the balance toward atop adsorption; for instance, the use of the hybrid B3LYP functional has been shown to favor top-site adsorption, bringing computed results into better agreement with experimental data (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 7-10, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 3-5). In contrast, calculations based solely on conventional semilocal GGA functionals such as PBE tend to yield a preference for hollow sites, highlighting the dependence of the adsorption prediction on the exchange\u2013correlation approximation employed (patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 3-5, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 16-20). Furthermore, investigations exploring the effects of coverage have suggested that while DFT calculations may predict the fcc hollow site as the most stable configuration at very low coverages, experimental evidence clearly indicates that atop sites are occupied exclusively in these regimes, with hollow sites gaining relevance only under specific high-coverage conditions (shan2009coveragedependentcoadsorption pages 1-2, gil2003sitepreferenceof pages 1-3). Thus, the \u201cCO/Pt(111) puzzle\u201d arises largely from these differences between computed and observed adsorption site preferences, with particular attention drawn to the role of functional choice and the need for improved treatment of electronic interactions, such as the inclusion of hybrid functionals or dispersion corrections (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7, orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2).\n\nIV. DFT Methodologies and Computational Parameters for CO Adsorption on Pt(111)  \nA number of computational protocols have been proposed and validated to accurately capture the adsorption behavior of CO on Pt(111), with careful consideration of the following constituents: DFT functionals, pseudopotentials, k-point sampling, slab models, and convergence parameters.\n\nA. DFT Functionals  \nThe choice of exchange\u2013correlation functional is critical in predicting the correct adsorption site. Early studies predominantly used GGA functionals, particularly the PW91 and PBE functionals, which typically resulted in predictions favoring the fcc hollow site due to their inherent inability to accurately describe the CO frontier orbital energies (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4, patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 3-5, grinberg2002coonpt pages 1-4). In contrast, hybrid functionals such as B3LYP have yielded results that align more closely with experimental measurements by predicting a stronger adsorption at the atop site (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 7-10, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7). Moreover, functionals like SCAN and approaches incorporating a Hubbard U correction (PBE+U) have been suggested as potential routes for mitigating self-interaction errors and improving the prediction of CO adsorption energies (patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 3-5, orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2). Additionally, dispersion-corrected DFT approaches (such as vdW-DFT) have been employed to account for London dispersion interactions, which are significant in determining relative stability among adsorption sites; these corrections have been noted to stabilize the top site relative to the hollow sites in certain cases (janthon2017addingpiecesto pages 4-7, doll2004coadsorptionon pages 4-7).\n\nB. Pseudopotentials and All-Electron Methods  \nFor heavy elements such as platinum, incorporation of relativistic effects is essential. Several studies have adopted scalar relativistic pseudopotentials that include 18 valence electrons for Pt, ensuring an accurate representation of the metal\u2019s electronic structure (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4, bleakley1999adensityfunctional pages 2-2). In some investigations, projector-augmented wave (PAW) methods have been utilized, as implemented in VASP, to yield converged total energy differences and accurate descriptions of the adsorption energies (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16). In contrast, all-electron approaches such as the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method have also been applied, delivering high-accuracy results by treating both core and valence electrons explicitly (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2). The consensus is that whether using pseudopotential methods or all-electron techniques, it is imperative to include full scalar relativistic corrections to correctly capture the bonding characteristics of CO on Pt(111) (bleakley1999adensityfunctional pages 2-2, patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 10-12).\n\nC. k-Point Sampling  \nConvergence with respect to k-point sampling is another critical factor in modeling periodic surfaces. Several DFT studies have demonstrated that a sufficiently dense k-point mesh is necessary to capture the subtleties of the electronic structure and to achieve converged adsorption energies. For instance, calculations employing the Dacapo code and ultrasoft pseudopotentials have reported convergence with a minimum basis cutoff, such as a 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 1 k-point grid for a (\u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3) surface unit cell (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2). In some cases, even denser k-point grids are recommended depending on the size of the surface cell and the nature of the adsorption pattern. Inadequate k-point sampling is one of the reasons for discrepancies in reported adsorption energies, and thus careful convergence tests are necessary (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2).\n\nD. Slab Models and Surface Representations  \nThe physical representation of the Pt(111) surface is typically achieved through slab models. A commonly adopted approach is to model the surface as a five-layer platinum slab in a face-centered cubic lattice, with the slab geometry optimized for the bulk Pt lattice constants\u2014typically in the range of 4.01 to 4.05 \u00c5 depending on the functional used (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4, doll2004coadsorptionon pages 7-10). A vacuum region of at least 10 \u00c5 is generally inserted between periodic images of the slab to avoid spurious interactions. For adsorption studies, the (\u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3) adsorption pattern has been validated, although other surface unit cells are sometimes employed to simulate varying coverages and adsorption structures (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4, steckel2003coadsorptionon pages 2-3). The thickness of the slab and the choice of adsorption unit cell can significantly influence the computed adsorption energies and preferred sites, which necessitates careful testing and convergence with respect to these parameters (grinberg2002coonpt pages 1-4, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16).\n\nE. Additional Computational Parameters  \nAdditional parameters that have been found to be essential for reliable DFT simulations include:  \n\u2013 Full geometry optimization with convergence criteria sufficiently tight to ensure that both the positions of the CO molecule and the surface atoms are accurately relaxed (orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2, steckel2003coadsorptionon pages 1-2).  \n\u2013 Fermi smearing, typically on the order of 0.002 hartree, to improve convergence in metallic systems (orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2).  \n\u2013 A real-space cutoff, for instance around 4 \u00c5 in some pseudopotential based approaches, to control the range of orbital interactions (orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2).  \n\u2013 The use of a sufficiently flexible basis set is crucial to prevent an erroneous prediction of adsorption site energetics, as an insufficiently flexible basis can bias the outcome toward an incorrect site preference (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7, gil2003sitepreferenceof pages 1-3).  \nCollectively, these computational ingredients\u2014when carefully optimized and validated\u2014enable DFT to provide an increasingly accurate description of CO adsorption on Pt(111), though discrepancies between different implementations still persist and highlight the ongoing challenges in computational surface science (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7).\n\nV. Discussion  \nThe discrepancies between experimental observations and DFT predictions of the preferred CO adsorption site on Pt(111) have long motivated methodological refinements. Experimental techniques unambiguously indicate that at low coverages, CO predominantly adsorbs on top sites; however, many early DFT studies using semilocal functionals predicted a preference for more highly coordinated sites such as the fcc hollow site. Disparities in binding energy estimates as small as 0.09 eV have been reported for the difference between the atop and bridge sites, yet the relative ordering and predicted equilibrium geometries were highly sensitive to the exchange\u2013correlation approximations employed (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, gunasooriya2018coadsorptionon pages 2-3, orita2004allelectronscalar pages 6-6).  \n\nThe root cause of this \u201cCO/Pt(111) puzzle\u201d lies in the intricacies of the electronic interactions between the CO molecule and the Pt surface. In particular, the balance between the donation of electron density from the CO 5\u03c3 orbital and back-donation into the CO 2\u03c0* orbital is exquisitely sensitive to the functional\u2019s treatment of electron correlation. The semilocal functionals tend to underestimate the HOMO\u2013LUMO gap of CO, leading to an exaggerated back-donation that favors adsorption in high coordination sites (sumaria2020optimalpackingof pages 4-8, patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 3-5). Hybrid functionals, which include a portion of exact exchange, have partially corrected this deficiency, yielding adsorption energy trends that are more consistent with the experimental preference for atop adsorption (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 7-10, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 3-5).\n\nFurthermore, a comprehensive understanding of the adsorption behavior requires not only the correct choice of functional but also rigorous attention to computational details such as the treatment of relativistic effects, k-point sampling, and slab model construction. Scalar relativistic corrections, implemented through pseudopotentials or all-electron methods, have emerged as critical for capturing the influence of platinum\u2019s heavy atoms and for reproducing the subtleties of the Pt\u2013CO bond (bleakley1999adensityfunctional pages 2-2, patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 10-12). Convergence with respect to k-point sampling and the use of sufficiently thick slab models further ensure that the periodic representation of the metal surface is accurate, thus reducing systematic errors associated with finite-size effects (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2).  \n\nOverall, despite the progress achieved with modern computational techniques, the subtle interplay of methodological factors means that DFT predictions must be carefully benchmarked against experimental observables. Recent studies that combine improved functionals (such as hybrid approaches or functionals with dispersion corrections) with high-quality computational parameters have narrowed the gap between theory and experiment, although some discrepancies in adsorption energies and site preferences remain (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 16-20, janthon2017addingpiecesto pages 4-7, sumaria2020optimalpackingof pages 1-4). These efforts illustrate the importance of integrating experimental benchmarks with computational sensitivity analyses to ultimately achieve a reliable and predictive model for CO adsorption on Pt(111).\n\nVI. Conclusion  \nIn conclusion, experimental studies using LEED, IR spectroscopy, STM, and related surface science techniques have consistently demonstrated that at low coverages on Pt(111), CO preferentially adsorbs at top sites, with minor contributions from bridge sites emerging under particular conditions (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4, doll2004coadsorptionon pages 7-10, sumaria2020optimalpackingof pages 15-18). In contrast, early computational simulations based on standard GGA functionals often predicted a preference for high-coordination hollow sites, a discrepancy that has fueled the so-called \u201cCO/Pt(111) puzzle\u201d (patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 3-5, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7). Advances in DFT methodologies, including the use of hybrid functionals (e.g., B3LYP), dispersion-corrected approaches, and rigorous treatments of relativistic effects, along with careful consideration of computational parameters such as pseudopotentials, k-point meshes, and slab geometries, have significantly improved the alignment between computed and experimental adsorption preferences (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 7-10, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2). Ultimately, a robust computational setup employs a sufficiently thick Pt(111) slab (typically five layers with optimized lattice constants of approximately 4.01\u20134.05 \u00c5), a periodic cell such as the (\u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3) unit with at least 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 1 k-point sampling, and scalar-relativistic pseudopotentials or all-electron methods that capture the full electronic structure of Pt (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4, grinberg2002coonpt pages 1-4). Supplementing semilocal functionals with hybrid functionals or corrections that address dispersion and self-interaction errors is critical to accurately model the subtle balance of the CO molecular orbitals and metal-induced interactions (sumaria2020optimalpackingof pages 4-8, orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2, janthon2017addingpiecesto pages 4-7).\n\nThese combined experimental and theoretical insights not only deepen our understanding of CO adsorption on Pt(111) but also guide the development of more accurate and predictive computational methodologies in surface science and heterogeneous catalysis. The integration of thorough experimental validation with advanced DFT calculations continues to be essential for resolving longstanding puzzles in adsorption phenomena, ultimately contributing to the rational design of catalytic surfaces with tailored reactivity (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7, sumaria2020optimalpackingof pages 12-15).\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Introduction  \\nCarbon monoxide (CO) adsorption on platinum (Pt(111)) surfaces has been intensively studied over the past decades owing to its importance in catalysis and surface science. Both experimental measurements and computational simulations have yielded valuable, albeit sometimes contradictory, insights regarding the preferred adsorption site of CO on Pt(111). This report summarizes the previously reported experimental observations and computational predictions, while also delineating the state\u2010of\u2010the-art density functional theory (DFT) methodologies that have been validated for modeling this system. The discussion emphasizes the nuances of the adsorption energy landscape, the sensitivity of computed site preferences to the choice of exchange\u2013correlation functionals and computational parameters, and the continuing challenges that give rise to what is commonly referred to as the \u201cCO/Pt(111) puzzle\u201d (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16).\\n\\nII. Experimental Observations on CO Adsorption Sites  \\nExperimental studies consistently indicate that, at low coverages, CO preferentially adsorbs at the top (on\u2010top) sites of the Pt(111) surface. Techniques such as low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), infrared spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and electron-energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) have revealed a dominant occupancy of atop sites under ultra-high vacuum conditions. For instance, LEED investigations identified ordered patterns in which, under a coverage of approximately one-third of a monolayer (ML), the majority of CO molecules occupy top sites, with minor contributions from bridge geometries at higher coverages (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4). Infrared absorption measurements have consistently reported peaks near 2090\u20132100 cm\u207b\u00b9, which are characteristic of CO molecules bonded perpendicular to the surface at top sites and provide further strong evidence of atop adsorption (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 7-10, gunasooriya2018coadsorptionsite pages 1-2). Additional experimental work has shown that for a half-monolayer, CO can form well-ordered structures\u2014for example, a c(4 \u00d7 2)-CO/Pt(111) arrangement in which one molecule is adsorbed at an atop site and another at a bridge site\u2014which underscores that while atop adsorption dominates, there can be a coexistence or transition to mixed configurations depending on the coverage and environmental conditions (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 16-20, sumaria2020optimalpackingof pages 12-15). Temperature-programmed desorption and other surface-sensitive techniques have quantified the chemisorption energy and indicated relatively small energy differences (on the order of 4\u20135 kJ/mol) between top and bridge sites, reinforcing the notion that even if the atop site is predominant, slight energetic competition exists at different coverages (grinberg2002coonpt pages 1-4, gunasooriya2018coadsorptionon pages 2-3). In summary, the experimental consensus is that at low CO coverage under controlled temperatures and pressures, the CO molecules are predominantly adsorbed on top sites, with any secondary contributions from bridge sites manifesting primarily at higher coverages or under particular adsorption conditions (sumaria2020optimalpackingof pages 15-18, patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 10-12).\\n\\nIII. Computational Simulations Using Density Functional Theory  \\nIn parallel with experimental efforts, computational investigations employing DFT have strived to elucidate the preferential adsorption site of CO on Pt(111). However, longstanding challenges have emerged because the results heavily depend on the specific approximations and computational parameters used. Early DFT studies often reported conflicting predictions, with several investigations favoring high-coordination sites such as the face-centered cubic (fcc) or hexagonal close-packed (hcp) hollow sites over the atop site\u2014a result in stark contrast to experimental observations (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4, grinberg2002coonpt pages 1-4). For example, several studies using generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functionals such as PW91 or PBE have predicted a site hierarchy in which the fcc hollow site is energetically most favorable, followed by hcp hollow, bridge, and finally top sites (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 4-7, janthon2017addingpiecesto pages 10-18). These discrepancies have been attributed to the sensitivity of CO adsorption energetics to the treatment of metal\u2013adsorbate interactions and to the shortcomings in capturing the proper energy differences associated with different bonding configurations, often linked to an underestimation of the HOMO\u2013LUMO gap of CO (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7, sumaria2020optimalpackingof pages 4-8).  \\n\\nSome computational studies have employed scalar relativistic corrections that underscore the importance of relativistic effects in Pt, and several works incorporating these effects with non-local or hybrid functionals suggest a shift in the balance toward atop adsorption; for instance, the use of the hybrid B3LYP functional has been shown to favor top-site adsorption, bringing computed results into better agreement with experimental data (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 7-10, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 3-5). In contrast, calculations based solely on conventional semilocal GGA functionals such as PBE tend to yield a preference for hollow sites, highlighting the dependence of the adsorption prediction on the exchange\u2013correlation approximation employed (patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 3-5, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 16-20). Furthermore, investigations exploring the effects of coverage have suggested that while DFT calculations may predict the fcc hollow site as the most stable configuration at very low coverages, experimental evidence clearly indicates that atop sites are occupied exclusively in these regimes, with hollow sites gaining relevance only under specific high-coverage conditions (shan2009coveragedependentcoadsorption pages 1-2, gil2003sitepreferenceof pages 1-3). Thus, the \u201cCO/Pt(111) puzzle\u201d arises largely from these differences between computed and observed adsorption site preferences, with particular attention drawn to the role of functional choice and the need for improved treatment of electronic interactions, such as the inclusion of hybrid functionals or dispersion corrections (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7, orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2).\\n\\nIV. DFT Methodologies and Computational Parameters for CO Adsorption on Pt(111)  \\nA number of computational protocols have been proposed and validated to accurately capture the adsorption behavior of CO on Pt(111), with careful consideration of the following constituents: DFT functionals, pseudopotentials, k-point sampling, slab models, and convergence parameters.\\n\\nA. DFT Functionals  \\nThe choice of exchange\u2013correlation functional is critical in predicting the correct adsorption site. Early studies predominantly used GGA functionals, particularly the PW91 and PBE functionals, which typically resulted in predictions favoring the fcc hollow site due to their inherent inability to accurately describe the CO frontier orbital energies (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4, patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 3-5, grinberg2002coonpt pages 1-4). In contrast, hybrid functionals such as B3LYP have yielded results that align more closely with experimental measurements by predicting a stronger adsorption at the atop site (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 7-10, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7). Moreover, functionals like SCAN and approaches incorporating a Hubbard U correction (PBE+U) have been suggested as potential routes for mitigating self-interaction errors and improving the prediction of CO adsorption energies (patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 3-5, orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2). Additionally, dispersion-corrected DFT approaches (such as vdW-DFT) have been employed to account for London dispersion interactions, which are significant in determining relative stability among adsorption sites; these corrections have been noted to stabilize the top site relative to the hollow sites in certain cases (janthon2017addingpiecesto pages 4-7, doll2004coadsorptionon pages 4-7).\\n\\nB. Pseudopotentials and All-Electron Methods  \\nFor heavy elements such as platinum, incorporation of relativistic effects is essential. Several studies have adopted scalar relativistic pseudopotentials that include 18 valence electrons for Pt, ensuring an accurate representation of the metal\u2019s electronic structure (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4, bleakley1999adensityfunctional pages 2-2). In some investigations, projector-augmented wave (PAW) methods have been utilized, as implemented in VASP, to yield converged total energy differences and accurate descriptions of the adsorption energies (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16). In contrast, all-electron approaches such as the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method have also been applied, delivering high-accuracy results by treating both core and valence electrons explicitly (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2). The consensus is that whether using pseudopotential methods or all-electron techniques, it is imperative to include full scalar relativistic corrections to correctly capture the bonding characteristics of CO on Pt(111) (bleakley1999adensityfunctional pages 2-2, patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 10-12).\\n\\nC. k-Point Sampling  \\nConvergence with respect to k-point sampling is another critical factor in modeling periodic surfaces. Several DFT studies have demonstrated that a sufficiently dense k-point mesh is necessary to capture the subtleties of the electronic structure and to achieve converged adsorption energies. For instance, calculations employing the Dacapo code and ultrasoft pseudopotentials have reported convergence with a minimum basis cutoff, such as a 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 1 k-point grid for a (\u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3) surface unit cell (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2). In some cases, even denser k-point grids are recommended depending on the size of the surface cell and the nature of the adsorption pattern. Inadequate k-point sampling is one of the reasons for discrepancies in reported adsorption energies, and thus careful convergence tests are necessary (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2).\\n\\nD. Slab Models and Surface Representations  \\nThe physical representation of the Pt(111) surface is typically achieved through slab models. A commonly adopted approach is to model the surface as a five-layer platinum slab in a face-centered cubic lattice, with the slab geometry optimized for the bulk Pt lattice constants\u2014typically in the range of 4.01 to 4.05 \u00c5 depending on the functional used (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4, doll2004coadsorptionon pages 7-10). A vacuum region of at least 10 \u00c5 is generally inserted between periodic images of the slab to avoid spurious interactions. For adsorption studies, the (\u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3) adsorption pattern has been validated, although other surface unit cells are sometimes employed to simulate varying coverages and adsorption structures (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4, steckel2003coadsorptionon pages 2-3). The thickness of the slab and the choice of adsorption unit cell can significantly influence the computed adsorption energies and preferred sites, which necessitates careful testing and convergence with respect to these parameters (grinberg2002coonpt pages 1-4, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16).\\n\\nE. Additional Computational Parameters  \\nAdditional parameters that have been found to be essential for reliable DFT simulations include:  \\n\u2013 Full geometry optimization with convergence criteria sufficiently tight to ensure that both the positions of the CO molecule and the surface atoms are accurately relaxed (orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2, steckel2003coadsorptionon pages 1-2).  \\n\u2013 Fermi smearing, typically on the order of 0.002 hartree, to improve convergence in metallic systems (orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2).  \\n\u2013 A real-space cutoff, for instance around 4 \u00c5 in some pseudopotential based approaches, to control the range of orbital interactions (orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2).  \\n\u2013 The use of a sufficiently flexible basis set is crucial to prevent an erroneous prediction of adsorption site energetics, as an insufficiently flexible basis can bias the outcome toward an incorrect site preference (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7, gil2003sitepreferenceof pages 1-3).  \\nCollectively, these computational ingredients\u2014when carefully optimized and validated\u2014enable DFT to provide an increasingly accurate description of CO adsorption on Pt(111), though discrepancies between different implementations still persist and highlight the ongoing challenges in computational surface science (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7).\\n\\nV. Discussion  \\nThe discrepancies between experimental observations and DFT predictions of the preferred CO adsorption site on Pt(111) have long motivated methodological refinements. Experimental techniques unambiguously indicate that at low coverages, CO predominantly adsorbs on top sites; however, many early DFT studies using semilocal functionals predicted a preference for more highly coordinated sites such as the fcc hollow site. Disparities in binding energy estimates as small as 0.09 eV have been reported for the difference between the atop and bridge sites, yet the relative ordering and predicted equilibrium geometries were highly sensitive to the exchange\u2013correlation approximations employed (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, gunasooriya2018coadsorptionon pages 2-3, orita2004allelectronscalar pages 6-6).  \\n\\nThe root cause of this \u201cCO/Pt(111) puzzle\u201d lies in the intricacies of the electronic interactions between the CO molecule and the Pt surface. In particular, the balance between the donation of electron density from the CO 5\u03c3 orbital and back-donation into the CO 2\u03c0* orbital is exquisitely sensitive to the functional\u2019s treatment of electron correlation. The semilocal functionals tend to underestimate the HOMO\u2013LUMO gap of CO, leading to an exaggerated back-donation that favors adsorption in high coordination sites (sumaria2020optimalpackingof pages 4-8, patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 3-5). Hybrid functionals, which include a portion of exact exchange, have partially corrected this deficiency, yielding adsorption energy trends that are more consistent with the experimental preference for atop adsorption (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 7-10, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 3-5).\\n\\nFurthermore, a comprehensive understanding of the adsorption behavior requires not only the correct choice of functional but also rigorous attention to computational details such as the treatment of relativistic effects, k-point sampling, and slab model construction. Scalar relativistic corrections, implemented through pseudopotentials or all-electron methods, have emerged as critical for capturing the influence of platinum\u2019s heavy atoms and for reproducing the subtleties of the Pt\u2013CO bond (bleakley1999adensityfunctional pages 2-2, patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 10-12). Convergence with respect to k-point sampling and the use of sufficiently thick slab models further ensure that the periodic representation of the metal surface is accurate, thus reducing systematic errors associated with finite-size effects (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2).  \\n\\nOverall, despite the progress achieved with modern computational techniques, the subtle interplay of methodological factors means that DFT predictions must be carefully benchmarked against experimental observables. Recent studies that combine improved functionals (such as hybrid approaches or functionals with dispersion corrections) with high-quality computational parameters have narrowed the gap between theory and experiment, although some discrepancies in adsorption energies and site preferences remain (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 16-20, janthon2017addingpiecesto pages 4-7, sumaria2020optimalpackingof pages 1-4). These efforts illustrate the importance of integrating experimental benchmarks with computational sensitivity analyses to ultimately achieve a reliable and predictive model for CO adsorption on Pt(111).\\n\\nVI. Conclusion  \\nIn conclusion, experimental studies using LEED, IR spectroscopy, STM, and related surface science techniques have consistently demonstrated that at low coverages on Pt(111), CO preferentially adsorbs at top sites, with minor contributions from bridge sites emerging under particular conditions (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4, doll2004coadsorptionon pages 7-10, sumaria2020optimalpackingof pages 15-18). In contrast, early computational simulations based on standard GGA functionals often predicted a preference for high-coordination hollow sites, a discrepancy that has fueled the so-called \u201cCO/Pt(111) puzzle\u201d (patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 3-5, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7). Advances in DFT methodologies, including the use of hybrid functionals (e.g., B3LYP), dispersion-corrected approaches, and rigorous treatments of relativistic effects, along with careful consideration of computational parameters such as pseudopotentials, k-point meshes, and slab geometries, have significantly improved the alignment between computed and experimental adsorption preferences (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 7-10, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2). Ultimately, a robust computational setup employs a sufficiently thick Pt(111) slab (typically five layers with optimized lattice constants of approximately 4.01\u20134.05 \u00c5), a periodic cell such as the (\u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3) unit with at least 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 1 k-point sampling, and scalar-relativistic pseudopotentials or all-electron methods that capture the full electronic structure of Pt (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4, grinberg2002coonpt pages 1-4). Supplementing semilocal functionals with hybrid functionals or corrections that address dispersion and self-interaction errors is critical to accurately model the subtle balance of the CO molecular orbitals and metal-induced interactions (sumaria2020optimalpackingof pages 4-8, orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2, janthon2017addingpiecesto pages 4-7).\\n\\nThese combined experimental and theoretical insights not only deepen our understanding of CO adsorption on Pt(111) but also guide the development of more accurate and predictive computational methodologies in surface science and heterogeneous catalysis. The integration of thorough experimental validation with advanced DFT calculations continues to be essential for resolving longstanding puzzles in adsorption phenomena, ultimately contributing to the rational design of catalytic surfaces with tailored reactivity (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7, sumaria2020optimalpackingof pages 12-15).\",\"formatted_answer\":\"Question: What are the previously reported results from both experimental studies and computational simulations regarding the preferred adsorption site of CO on Pt(111) surfaces? Additionally, how can this adsorption preference be computed using density functional theory (DFT), including which DFT functionals, pseudopotentials, k-point meshes, slab models, and other computational parameters have been validated and are recommended for accurately modeling CO adsorption on Pt(111)?\\n\\nI. Introduction  \\nCarbon monoxide (CO) adsorption on platinum (Pt(111)) surfaces has been intensively studied over the past decades owing to its importance in catalysis and surface science. Both experimental measurements and computational simulations have yielded valuable, albeit sometimes contradictory, insights regarding the preferred adsorption site of CO on Pt(111). This report summarizes the previously reported experimental observations and computational predictions, while also delineating the state\u2010of\u2010the-art density functional theory (DFT) methodologies that have been validated for modeling this system. The discussion emphasizes the nuances of the adsorption energy landscape, the sensitivity of computed site preferences to the choice of exchange\u2013correlation functionals and computational parameters, and the continuing challenges that give rise to what is commonly referred to as the \u201cCO/Pt(111) puzzle\u201d (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16).\\n\\nII. Experimental Observations on CO Adsorption Sites  \\nExperimental studies consistently indicate that, at low coverages, CO preferentially adsorbs at the top (on\u2010top) sites of the Pt(111) surface. Techniques such as low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), infrared spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and electron-energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) have revealed a dominant occupancy of atop sites under ultra-high vacuum conditions. For instance, LEED investigations identified ordered patterns in which, under a coverage of approximately one-third of a monolayer (ML), the majority of CO molecules occupy top sites, with minor contributions from bridge geometries at higher coverages (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4). Infrared absorption measurements have consistently reported peaks near 2090\u20132100 cm\u207b\u00b9, which are characteristic of CO molecules bonded perpendicular to the surface at top sites and provide further strong evidence of atop adsorption (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 7-10, gunasooriya2018coadsorptionsite pages 1-2). Additional experimental work has shown that for a half-monolayer, CO can form well-ordered structures\u2014for example, a c(4 \u00d7 2)-CO/Pt(111) arrangement in which one molecule is adsorbed at an atop site and another at a bridge site\u2014which underscores that while atop adsorption dominates, there can be a coexistence or transition to mixed configurations depending on the coverage and environmental conditions (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 16-20, sumaria2020optimalpackingof pages 12-15). Temperature-programmed desorption and other surface-sensitive techniques have quantified the chemisorption energy and indicated relatively small energy differences (on the order of 4\u20135 kJ/mol) between top and bridge sites, reinforcing the notion that even if the atop site is predominant, slight energetic competition exists at different coverages (grinberg2002coonpt pages 1-4, gunasooriya2018coadsorptionon pages 2-3). In summary, the experimental consensus is that at low CO coverage under controlled temperatures and pressures, the CO molecules are predominantly adsorbed on top sites, with any secondary contributions from bridge sites manifesting primarily at higher coverages or under particular adsorption conditions (sumaria2020optimalpackingof pages 15-18, patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 10-12).\\n\\nIII. Computational Simulations Using Density Functional Theory  \\nIn parallel with experimental efforts, computational investigations employing DFT have strived to elucidate the preferential adsorption site of CO on Pt(111). However, longstanding challenges have emerged because the results heavily depend on the specific approximations and computational parameters used. Early DFT studies often reported conflicting predictions, with several investigations favoring high-coordination sites such as the face-centered cubic (fcc) or hexagonal close-packed (hcp) hollow sites over the atop site\u2014a result in stark contrast to experimental observations (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4, grinberg2002coonpt pages 1-4). For example, several studies using generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functionals such as PW91 or PBE have predicted a site hierarchy in which the fcc hollow site is energetically most favorable, followed by hcp hollow, bridge, and finally top sites (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 4-7, janthon2017addingpiecesto pages 10-18). These discrepancies have been attributed to the sensitivity of CO adsorption energetics to the treatment of metal\u2013adsorbate interactions and to the shortcomings in capturing the proper energy differences associated with different bonding configurations, often linked to an underestimation of the HOMO\u2013LUMO gap of CO (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7, sumaria2020optimalpackingof pages 4-8).  \\n\\nSome computational studies have employed scalar relativistic corrections that underscore the importance of relativistic effects in Pt, and several works incorporating these effects with non-local or hybrid functionals suggest a shift in the balance toward atop adsorption; for instance, the use of the hybrid B3LYP functional has been shown to favor top-site adsorption, bringing computed results into better agreement with experimental data (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 7-10, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 3-5). In contrast, calculations based solely on conventional semilocal GGA functionals such as PBE tend to yield a preference for hollow sites, highlighting the dependence of the adsorption prediction on the exchange\u2013correlation approximation employed (patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 3-5, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 16-20). Furthermore, investigations exploring the effects of coverage have suggested that while DFT calculations may predict the fcc hollow site as the most stable configuration at very low coverages, experimental evidence clearly indicates that atop sites are occupied exclusively in these regimes, with hollow sites gaining relevance only under specific high-coverage conditions (shan2009coveragedependentcoadsorption pages 1-2, gil2003sitepreferenceof pages 1-3). Thus, the \u201cCO/Pt(111) puzzle\u201d arises largely from these differences between computed and observed adsorption site preferences, with particular attention drawn to the role of functional choice and the need for improved treatment of electronic interactions, such as the inclusion of hybrid functionals or dispersion corrections (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7, orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2).\\n\\nIV. DFT Methodologies and Computational Parameters for CO Adsorption on Pt(111)  \\nA number of computational protocols have been proposed and validated to accurately capture the adsorption behavior of CO on Pt(111), with careful consideration of the following constituents: DFT functionals, pseudopotentials, k-point sampling, slab models, and convergence parameters.\\n\\nA. DFT Functionals  \\nThe choice of exchange\u2013correlation functional is critical in predicting the correct adsorption site. Early studies predominantly used GGA functionals, particularly the PW91 and PBE functionals, which typically resulted in predictions favoring the fcc hollow site due to their inherent inability to accurately describe the CO frontier orbital energies (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4, patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 3-5, grinberg2002coonpt pages 1-4). In contrast, hybrid functionals such as B3LYP have yielded results that align more closely with experimental measurements by predicting a stronger adsorption at the atop site (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 7-10, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7). Moreover, functionals like SCAN and approaches incorporating a Hubbard U correction (PBE+U) have been suggested as potential routes for mitigating self-interaction errors and improving the prediction of CO adsorption energies (patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 3-5, orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2). Additionally, dispersion-corrected DFT approaches (such as vdW-DFT) have been employed to account for London dispersion interactions, which are significant in determining relative stability among adsorption sites; these corrections have been noted to stabilize the top site relative to the hollow sites in certain cases (janthon2017addingpiecesto pages 4-7, doll2004coadsorptionon pages 4-7).\\n\\nB. Pseudopotentials and All-Electron Methods  \\nFor heavy elements such as platinum, incorporation of relativistic effects is essential. Several studies have adopted scalar relativistic pseudopotentials that include 18 valence electrons for Pt, ensuring an accurate representation of the metal\u2019s electronic structure (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4, bleakley1999adensityfunctional pages 2-2). In some investigations, projector-augmented wave (PAW) methods have been utilized, as implemented in VASP, to yield converged total energy differences and accurate descriptions of the adsorption energies (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16). In contrast, all-electron approaches such as the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method have also been applied, delivering high-accuracy results by treating both core and valence electrons explicitly (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2). The consensus is that whether using pseudopotential methods or all-electron techniques, it is imperative to include full scalar relativistic corrections to correctly capture the bonding characteristics of CO on Pt(111) (bleakley1999adensityfunctional pages 2-2, patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 10-12).\\n\\nC. k-Point Sampling  \\nConvergence with respect to k-point sampling is another critical factor in modeling periodic surfaces. Several DFT studies have demonstrated that a sufficiently dense k-point mesh is necessary to capture the subtleties of the electronic structure and to achieve converged adsorption energies. For instance, calculations employing the Dacapo code and ultrasoft pseudopotentials have reported convergence with a minimum basis cutoff, such as a 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 1 k-point grid for a (\u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3) surface unit cell (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2). In some cases, even denser k-point grids are recommended depending on the size of the surface cell and the nature of the adsorption pattern. Inadequate k-point sampling is one of the reasons for discrepancies in reported adsorption energies, and thus careful convergence tests are necessary (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2).\\n\\nD. Slab Models and Surface Representations  \\nThe physical representation of the Pt(111) surface is typically achieved through slab models. A commonly adopted approach is to model the surface as a five-layer platinum slab in a face-centered cubic lattice, with the slab geometry optimized for the bulk Pt lattice constants\u2014typically in the range of 4.01 to 4.05 \u00c5 depending on the functional used (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4, doll2004coadsorptionon pages 7-10). A vacuum region of at least 10 \u00c5 is generally inserted between periodic images of the slab to avoid spurious interactions. For adsorption studies, the (\u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3) adsorption pattern has been validated, although other surface unit cells are sometimes employed to simulate varying coverages and adsorption structures (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4, steckel2003coadsorptionon pages 2-3). The thickness of the slab and the choice of adsorption unit cell can significantly influence the computed adsorption energies and preferred sites, which necessitates careful testing and convergence with respect to these parameters (grinberg2002coonpt pages 1-4, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16).\\n\\nE. Additional Computational Parameters  \\nAdditional parameters that have been found to be essential for reliable DFT simulations include:  \\n\u2013 Full geometry optimization with convergence criteria sufficiently tight to ensure that both the positions of the CO molecule and the surface atoms are accurately relaxed (orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2, steckel2003coadsorptionon pages 1-2).  \\n\u2013 Fermi smearing, typically on the order of 0.002 hartree, to improve convergence in metallic systems (orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2).  \\n\u2013 A real-space cutoff, for instance around 4 \u00c5 in some pseudopotential based approaches, to control the range of orbital interactions (orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2).  \\n\u2013 The use of a sufficiently flexible basis set is crucial to prevent an erroneous prediction of adsorption site energetics, as an insufficiently flexible basis can bias the outcome toward an incorrect site preference (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7, gil2003sitepreferenceof pages 1-3).  \\nCollectively, these computational ingredients\u2014when carefully optimized and validated\u2014enable DFT to provide an increasingly accurate description of CO adsorption on Pt(111), though discrepancies between different implementations still persist and highlight the ongoing challenges in computational surface science (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7).\\n\\nV. Discussion  \\nThe discrepancies between experimental observations and DFT predictions of the preferred CO adsorption site on Pt(111) have long motivated methodological refinements. Experimental techniques unambiguously indicate that at low coverages, CO predominantly adsorbs on top sites; however, many early DFT studies using semilocal functionals predicted a preference for more highly coordinated sites such as the fcc hollow site. Disparities in binding energy estimates as small as 0.09 eV have been reported for the difference between the atop and bridge sites, yet the relative ordering and predicted equilibrium geometries were highly sensitive to the exchange\u2013correlation approximations employed (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, gunasooriya2018coadsorptionon pages 2-3, orita2004allelectronscalar pages 6-6).  \\n\\nThe root cause of this \u201cCO/Pt(111) puzzle\u201d lies in the intricacies of the electronic interactions between the CO molecule and the Pt surface. In particular, the balance between the donation of electron density from the CO 5\u03c3 orbital and back-donation into the CO 2\u03c0* orbital is exquisitely sensitive to the functional\u2019s treatment of electron correlation. The semilocal functionals tend to underestimate the HOMO\u2013LUMO gap of CO, leading to an exaggerated back-donation that favors adsorption in high coordination sites (sumaria2020optimalpackingof pages 4-8, patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 3-5). Hybrid functionals, which include a portion of exact exchange, have partially corrected this deficiency, yielding adsorption energy trends that are more consistent with the experimental preference for atop adsorption (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 7-10, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 3-5).\\n\\nFurthermore, a comprehensive understanding of the adsorption behavior requires not only the correct choice of functional but also rigorous attention to computational details such as the treatment of relativistic effects, k-point sampling, and slab model construction. Scalar relativistic corrections, implemented through pseudopotentials or all-electron methods, have emerged as critical for capturing the influence of platinum\u2019s heavy atoms and for reproducing the subtleties of the Pt\u2013CO bond (bleakley1999adensityfunctional pages 2-2, patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 10-12). Convergence with respect to k-point sampling and the use of sufficiently thick slab models further ensure that the periodic representation of the metal surface is accurate, thus reducing systematic errors associated with finite-size effects (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2).  \\n\\nOverall, despite the progress achieved with modern computational techniques, the subtle interplay of methodological factors means that DFT predictions must be carefully benchmarked against experimental observables. Recent studies that combine improved functionals (such as hybrid approaches or functionals with dispersion corrections) with high-quality computational parameters have narrowed the gap between theory and experiment, although some discrepancies in adsorption energies and site preferences remain (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 16-20, janthon2017addingpiecesto pages 4-7, sumaria2020optimalpackingof pages 1-4). These efforts illustrate the importance of integrating experimental benchmarks with computational sensitivity analyses to ultimately achieve a reliable and predictive model for CO adsorption on Pt(111).\\n\\nVI. Conclusion  \\nIn conclusion, experimental studies using LEED, IR spectroscopy, STM, and related surface science techniques have consistently demonstrated that at low coverages on Pt(111), CO preferentially adsorbs at top sites, with minor contributions from bridge sites emerging under particular conditions (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 7-11, doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4, doll2004coadsorptionon pages 7-10, sumaria2020optimalpackingof pages 15-18). In contrast, early computational simulations based on standard GGA functionals often predicted a preference for high-coordination hollow sites, a discrepancy that has fueled the so-called \u201cCO/Pt(111) puzzle\u201d (patra2019rethinkingcoadsorption pages 3-5, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 1-7). Advances in DFT methodologies, including the use of hybrid functionals (e.g., B3LYP), dispersion-corrected approaches, and rigorous treatments of relativistic effects, along with careful consideration of computational parameters such as pseudopotentials, k-point meshes, and slab geometries, have significantly improved the alignment between computed and experimental adsorption preferences (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 7-10, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2). Ultimately, a robust computational setup employs a sufficiently thick Pt(111) slab (typically five layers with optimized lattice constants of approximately 4.01\u20134.05 \u00c5), a periodic cell such as the (\u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3) unit with at least 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 1 k-point sampling, and scalar-relativistic pseudopotentials or all-electron methods that capture the full electronic structure of Pt (doll2004coadsorptionon pages 1-4, grinberg2002coonpt pages 1-4). Supplementing semilocal functionals with hybrid functionals or corrections that address dispersion and self-interaction errors is critical to accurately model the subtle balance of the CO molecular orbitals and metal-induced interactions (sumaria2020optimalpackingof pages 4-8, orita2004allelectronscalar pages 1-2, janthon2017addingpiecesto pages 4-7).\\n\\nThese combined experimental and theoretical insights not only deepen our understanding of CO adsorption on Pt(111) but also guide the development of more accurate and predictive computational methodologies in surface science and heterogeneous catalysis. The integration of thorough experimental validation with advanced DFT calculations continues to be essential for resolving longstanding puzzles in adsorption phenomena, ultimately contributing to the rational design of catalytic surfaces with tailored reactivity (stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 1-4, stroppa2007coadsorptionon pages 4-7, sumaria2020optimalpackingof pages 12-15).\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

Both experimental techniques\u2014such as neutron and X\u2010ray diffraction\u2014and simulation methods yield lattice parameters that vary only marginally with the hydrogen-to-yttrium (H/Y) ratio, typically spanning values between 1.31 and 2.0 or more specifically between 1.47 and 1.96. In addition, the procedure for computing the lattice constant with DFT is elaborated on, including the use of the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange-correlation energy, the Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof (PBE) functional, a plane-wave cutoff energy of 500 eV, a Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh (typically 5\u00d75\u00d75), and appropriate Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) pseudopotentials. The compiled evidence indicates that the chosen parameters lead to highly reliable predictions with minor deviations (typically on the order of 0.01 \u00c5) from the corresponding experimental measurements.\n\n1. Introduction  \nUnderstanding the lattice constants of metal hydrides, and in particular yttrium hydride (YH\u2082), is essential for tailoring their physical and mechanical properties for applications that range from neutron moderation to advanced energy storage. The structural parameters, including lattice constants, are sensitive to hydrogen stoichiometry; thus, accurate measurements and predictions are critical. Over the years, numerous experimental studies have measured the lattice parameters using neutron diffraction, X-ray diffraction, and resonant ultrasound spectroscopy, while complementary simulation studies employing density functional theory (DFT) have provided insights into the electronic structure and corresponding mechanical properties. Many of these investigations have reported that the lattice parameters for YH\u2082 vary only modestly as the hydrogen content is changed, with typical H/Y ratios extending from as low as 1.31 up to 2.0, and a more widely studied range between approximately 1.47 and 1.96 (mehta2022amodelingand pages 2-4, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4).\n\nModern DFT simulations effectively reproduce experimental observations when the computational parameters are properly chosen. Notably, widely accepted settings include using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange-correlation energy, typically in its Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof (PBE) parameterization, along with a plane-wave cutoff energy of 500 eV. The Brillouin zone is sampled using a Monkhorst-Pack grid, with a common mesh size of 5\u00d75\u00d75 for these systems, although some studies have explored the impact of denser meshes (such as 7\u00d77\u00d77 or even 10\u00d710\u00d710) in particular applications (shivprasad2021thermophysicalpropertiesof pages 2-3, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 2-3). The use of PAW pseudopotentials has been shown to be critical in accurately representing the ionic cores, thereby ensuring an adequate description of the chemical bonding and the resultant lattice parameters (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 2-3).\n\nThis report is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the experimental and simulation results for the lattice constants of YH\u2082 with different stoichiometries. Section 3 provides an in-depth discussion on the computational methodology for calculating the lattice constant using DFT, including an analysis of the validated and recommended parameters for ensuring accurate results. Section 4 discusses the comparison between experimental measurements and simulation outputs and highlights the subtle effects of stoichiometric variations. Finally, Section 5 concludes with a summary of our main findings.\n\n2. Overview of Experimental and Simulation Results  \nExperimental investigations into the structural properties of YH\u2082 have primarily employed diffraction techniques such as neutron diffraction and X-ray diffraction. These studies report lattice constants for yttrium hydride over hydrogen-to-yttrium ratios typically spanning from 1.47 to 1.96. In one set of studies, the diffraction results indicate that the lattice parameters exhibit minimal changes with varying stoichiometry. For example, measurements made via neutron diffraction have demonstrated that the lattice constant remains nearly constant across different H/Y ratios, with only a slight increase observed when a hydrogen vacancy is present or as the temperature changes (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 6-7).\n\nSome reports provide direct comparisons between DFT simulation results and experimental data. In several instances, the DFT-calculated lattice parameters for stoichiometric YH\u2082 were found to overestimate the experimentally measured values by approximately 0.01 \u00c5. One study, for instance, reported experimental values of a = b \u2248 3.667 \u00c5 and c \u2248 5.793 \u00c5 obtained from neutron diffraction, while DFT computations yielded a = b \u2248 3.658 \u00c5 and c \u2248 5.677 \u00c5 (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 7-9). This close agreement indicates that the DFT method\u2014when implemented with properly chosen simulation parameters\u2014is robust in its predictive capability. In addition, the variations of the lattice constant as a function of the H/Y ratio have been quantified; for example, one analysis found a variation slope of approximately \u22120.0055 \u00c5 per unit increase in the H/Y ratio, and another highlighted an overall change of only about 0.004 \u00c5 for ratios ranging from 1.31 to 2.0 (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 6-7, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 1-2).\n\nMoreover, complementary simulation studies have reported that the density of YH\u2082 predicted by DFT is approximately 4.26 g/cm\u00b3, which is in very close proximity to the experimental value of around 4.30 g/cm\u00b3 (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 7-9). Such consistency between experimental measures and DFT predictions underscores the validity of the computational approach and the selected parameters, and it reinforces the confidence in applying these techniques to explore subtle structural variations induced by stoichiometric changes (shivprasad2021thermophysicalpropertiesof pages 2-3).\n\n3. Density Functional Theory Methodology for Lattice Constant Calculation  \nDensity functional theory has emerged as a powerful tool for predicting the structural and electronic properties of materials, including lattice constants, with a high degree of accuracy. In the context of YH\u2082, the reliability of DFT hinges on the careful selection of simulation parameters. The following subsections detail the methodology, starting from the choice of exchange-correlation functional to the convergence criteria employed in the calculations.\n\n3.1 Exchange-Correlation Functional and Pseudopotentials  \nThe most widely used approach in DFT calculations for YH\u2082 is based on the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange-correlation functional. In nearly all the studies reviewed, the Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof (PBE) formulation of the GGA has been adopted because it reliably produces accurate lattice parameters and mechanical properties (mehta2022amodelingand pages 2-4, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4). This functional has been validated against experimental data and is known to capture the essential physics underlying the bonding interactions between yttrium and hydrogen atoms. Furthermore, several investigations have utilized Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) pseudopotentials to represent the core electrons of yttrium and hydrogen accurately. The PAW method is particularly effective because it combines the accuracy of all-electron calculations with the computational efficiency of pseudopotentials, ensuring that the computed lattice parameters are not compromised by an inadequate description of the ionic cores (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4).\n\n3.2 Plane-Wave Basis Set and Cutoff Energy  \nIn plane-wave DFT calculations, the accuracy of the computed wavefunctions depends on the plane-wave cutoff energy. For YH\u2082, extensive studies have converged on a cutoff energy of 500 eV as being sufficient to accurately describe the electron density and total energy of the system (mehta2022amodelingand pages 2-4, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4). A cutoff of 500 eV is high enough to ensure that basis-set incompleteness errors are minimized, while still remaining computationally tractable. This choice has been validated by comparison with experimental lattice constants and is further supported by additional simulation efforts that report consistent values across diverse stoichiometries (shivprasad2021thermophysicalpropertiesof pages 2-3, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 2-3).\n\n3.3 k-Point Sampling in the Brillouin Zone  \nAnother critical factor influencing the accuracy of DFT calculations is the sampling of the Brillouin zone via the k-point mesh. In the studies under review, a Monkhorst-Pack grid of 5\u00d75\u00d75 is the most commonly employed configuration (mehta2022amodelingand pages 2-4, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4). This mesh provides a balanced trade-off between computational efficiency and precision in the evaluation of the electronic states. Although a denser k-mesh (e.g., 7\u00d77\u00d77 or 10\u00d710\u00d710) has been explored in some cases, particularly when investigating mechanical properties or subtle electronic features, the 5\u00d75\u00d75 grid remains the validated standard for lattice constant calculations, ensuring that the total energy is converged to within approximately 1 meV per atom (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 2-3).\n\n3.4 Convergence Criteria and Supercell Considerations  \nHigh-precision DFT calculations further depend on stringent convergence criteria. Several studies have adopted electronic convergence thresholds on the order of 10^(-6) eV and ionic convergence criteria of approximately 10^(-5) eV to ensure that the computed lattice constants are not affected by numerical errors (shivprasad2021thermophysicalpropertiesof pages 2-3). In addition, some investigations have considered supercell approaches\u2014using supercells containing up to 96 atoms\u2014particularly when performing temperature-dependent calculations or when analyzing defect structures and hydrogen vacancies. These supercell calculations have provided additional insights into the minimal variation of lattice constants with stoichiometry and the stabilization mechanisms provided by hydrogen occupying tetrahedral sites in the crystal lattice (chapman2020thermalneutronscattering pages 18-20, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 1-2).\n\n3.5 Implementation in VASP  \nThe implementation of the methodological framework is typically carried out using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP), which has become the de facto standard for first-principles calculations on transition metal hydrides. VASP enables the practical application of the aforementioned established DFT parameters and has been instrumental in validating the lattice constants of YH\u2082 against experimental benchmarks. In the studies reviewed, VASP simulations employing GGA-PBE, a 500 eV plane-wave cutoff, PAW pseudopotentials, and a 5\u00d75\u00d75 k-point mesh consistently yielded lattice constants that deviated by only 0.01 \u00c5 from neutron diffraction measurements (mehta2022amodelingand pages 2-4).\n\n4. Results and Comparative Analysis  \nIn this section, we present a detailed comparative analysis of the lattice constants of YH\u2082 as reported by experimental and simulation studies. A key finding across multiple reports is that the lattice parameters for YH\u2082 are remarkably robust with respect to changes in hydrogen stoichiometry, with only minimal variations observed even when the H/Y ratio is altered over a wide range.\n\n4.1 Experimental Measurement of Lattice Constants  \nExperimental determinations of lattice constants for YH\u2082 have been conducted using neutron diffraction, X-ray diffraction, and Rietveld refinement techniques. For stoichiometric YH\u2082, neutron diffraction measurements have yielded lattice parameters on the order of a = b \u2248 3.667 \u00c5 and c \u2248 5.793 \u00c5. These values have been corroborated by additional X-ray diffraction studies, which typically report H/Y ratios in the range of 1.47 to 1.96 (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 2-3). In some investigations, the experimental protocols further involve sophisticated post-processing methods such as extraction refining processes to precisely determine the lattice constants. Despite slight differences between individual measurements, the general consensus is that the lattice constant remains nearly invariant with stoichiometry, with only very small expansions attributed to the formation of hydrogen vacancies (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 6-7).\n\n4.2 DFT Simulation of Lattice Constants  \nDFT simulations of YH\u2082, when performed with the validated parameters, yield lattice constants that are in excellent agreement with experimental values. For instance, simulations employing a 500 eV cutoff, a 5\u00d75\u00d75 k-point mesh, and GGA-PBE with PAW pseudopotentials have produced lattice constants for stoichiometric YH\u2082 that are approximately a = b \u2248 3.658 \u00c5 and c \u2248 5.677 \u00c5. The observed discrepancy of about 0.01 \u00c5 when compared with experimental data has been attributed to intrinsic limitations inherent in the exchange-correlation functional and the fact that DFT typically assesses the system at 0 K, while experiments are conducted at ambient or elevated temperatures (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 7-9, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 6-7). Furthermore, additional simulations have highlighted that the variation in lattice constants with changes in the H/Y ratio is minimal, with the DFT results indicating changes on the order of only 0.004 \u00c5 across stoichiometries between 1.31 and 2.0 (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 1-2). Such subtle changes are quantitatively captured through a slope of approximately \u22120.0055 \u00c5 per unit change in the H/Y ratio, emphasizing that the structural framework of YH\u2082 remains highly robust despite stoichiometric modification (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 6-7).\n\n4.3 Comparison of Experimental and Simulation Data  \nA detailed comparison of the experimental and computational results reveals a striking consistency between the two approaches. On one hand, experimental measurements consistently yield lattice parameters that are only marginally different from those predicted by DFT when employing the standard set of parameters. On the other hand, simulation studies benefit from the ability to explore the influence of defects, temperature, and bonding states on the lattice constant in a controlled manner. For example, density functional theory calculations have provided further insights into the effect of hydrogen vacancies, where the introduction of vacancies in the stoichiometric YH\u2082 lattice creates only a slight lattice expansion, a phenomenon also observed in neutron diffraction studies (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 6-7).\n\nIn addition to lattice constants, the computed density of YH\u2082 has been a benchmark for assessing the accuracy of the simulations. DFT calculations have yielded a density of approximately 4.26 g/cm\u00b3, which is in excellent agreement with experimental determinations of around 4.30 g/cm\u00b3 (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 7-9). This close match reinforces the notion that the DFT methods, when implemented with the recommended parameters, are highly reliable not only for the prediction of lattice parameters but also for the estimation of other structural properties.\n\n5. Discussion  \nThe excellent agreement between experimental lattice constants and DFT predictions for YH\u2082 is a testament to the maturity of both the experimental techniques and computational methods employed in this field. The successful application of DFT in calculating structural parameters for YH\u2082 can be attributed to several factors, the foremost being the selection of a robust exchange-correlation functional (i.e., GGA-PBE), which is widely recognized for its ability to capture the essential physics of transition metal hydrides (mehta2022amodelingand pages 2-4, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4).\n\nThe use of a plane-wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 500 eV has proven sufficient to achieve convergence in the total energy and electronic density, thereby ensuring that the computational predictions of the lattice constant are not significantly affected by the limits of the basis set (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4, shivprasad2021thermophysicalpropertiesof pages 2-3). Likewise, the employment of a 5\u00d75\u00d75 Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid provides an optimal balance between computational cost and accuracy, as demonstrated by the slight deviations (on the order of 0.01 \u00c5) observed when comparing DFT results with experimental values (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 2-3).\n\nIt is also noteworthy that some studies have explored the impact of temperature on the lattice constant. In these investigations, it was found that DFT calculations\u2014typically performed at 0 K\u2014tend to overpredict the lattice constant by a small margin (approximately 0.2%) relative to high-temperature neutron diffraction experiments (mehta2022amodelingand pages 5-10). Such discrepancies are not only within acceptable limits but also highlight the intrinsic differences between static zero-Kelvin calculations and experiments performed at finite temperatures, where thermal expansion effects become significant.\n\nThe subtle variations of lattice constants with changes in stoichiometry, whether due to slight differences in the H/Y ratio or the formation of hydrogen vacancies, are captured with remarkable precision in DFT simulations. The finding that the lattice constant changes by only about 0.004 \u00c5 across a broad range of stoichiometries (from 1.31 to 2.0) emphasizes the structural robustness of the YH\u2082 lattice and suggests that the material\u2019s mechanical and thermodynamic properties are largely insensitive to modest deviations in hydrogen content (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 1-2, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 6-7). Moreover, the observation that hydrogen preferentially occupies tetrahedral sites in the lattice\u2014as revealed through defect analysis in DFT studies\u2014provides a microscopic explanation for the minimal expansion observed experimentally (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 6-7).\n\nA noteworthy point in the discussion is the occasional variation in the k-point grid size observed in the literature. While the 5\u00d75\u00d75 mesh is the most frequently adopted setup, some works have employed a 7\u00d77\u00d77 grid or even a denser 10\u00d710\u00d710 mesh when investigating other properties such as elastic constants or phonon dispersion relations (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4, li2014mechanicalandthermodynamic pages 1-3). These variations, however, do not significantly alter the computed lattice parameters, reaffirming that the standard parameters remain robust across different physical contexts and that any minor discrepancies fall within the expected error margins of DFT calculations.\n\nIn addition, the careful choice of convergence criteria (with electronic convergence on the order of 10^(-6) eV and ionic convergence of 10^(-5) eV) has been critical in ensuring that the computed lattice constants are not influenced by numerical uncertainties (shivprasad2021thermophysicalpropertiesof pages 2-3). The high level of precision achieved in these simulations is essential when making direct comparisons with experimentally measured values, where even differences of a few thousandths of an angstrom can be significant for subsequent applications or for validating theoretical models.\n\nFinally, the implementation of these DFT protocols using VASP has not only provided reliable computational predictions but also enabled systematic studies of the effect of temperature, pressure, and stoichiometry on the structural properties of YH\u2082. The widespread adoption of these protocols across multiple studies lends further credence to their validity and highlights the continuing importance of DFT in the materials science community.\n\n6. Conclusions  \nIn summary, a comprehensive analysis of both experimental and simulation results for the lattice constants of yttrium hydride (YH\u2082) reveals a high level of agreement between the two. Experimental studies employing neutron and X-ray diffraction consistently report lattice constants that vary very little with hydrogen stoichiometry, with typical H/Y ratios in the range of approximately 1.47 to 1.96, and in some cases extending from 1.31 to 2.0. DFT simulations, when performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) with a validated set of parameters\u2014that is, the use of the GGA-PBE exchange-correlation functional, PAW pseudopotentials, a plane-wave cutoff energy of 500 eV, and a 5\u00d75\u00d75 Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh\u2014yield lattice constants that differ from experimental values by only about 0.01 \u00c5. This minor deviation is attributed primarily to the inherent approximations of the DFT method and the zero-Kelvin nature of the simulations. It is also noted that DFT calculations predict a slight overestimation of the lattice constant (by approximately 0.2%) compared to high-temperature neutron diffraction measurements, a trend that is well understood in the context of thermal expansion effects.\n\nFurthermore, both experimental and computational studies confirm that the lattice constant of YH\u2082 is remarkably insensitive to changes in hydrogen stoichiometry, with variations on the order of 0.004 \u00c5 being observed across a broad range of H/Y ratios. The subtle variations\u2014quantified by a slope of roughly \u22120.0055 \u00c5 per unit change in the H/Y ratio\u2014emphasize the robust structural framework of YH\u2082, which remains largely unaffected by moderate deviations in hydrogen content. In addition to the lattice constant, the density values predicted by DFT (approximately 4.26 g/cm\u00b3) are in excellent agreement with experimental measurements (~4.30 g/cm\u00b3), further validating the chosen computational approach.\n\nOverall, the compiled evidence from multiple studies underscores that the recommended DFT parameters (GGA-PBE, 500 eV cutoff, 5\u00d75\u00d75 k-point mesh, and PAW pseudopotentials) are not only validated by direct comparisons with experimental data but are also robust in predicting the structural properties of YH\u2082 across a wide range of stoichiometries. These findings provide a firm basis for future exploratory studies and practical applications involving yttrium hydride, as researchers can be confident in the accuracy and reliability of the computational framework outlined herein (mehta2022amodelingand pages 2-4, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4, shivprasad2021thermophysicalpropertiesof pages 2-3, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 2-3, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 6-7, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 7-9, li2014mechanicalandthermodynamic pages 1-3, mehta2022amodelingand pages 5-10, chapman2020thermalneutronscattering pages 18-20, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 1-2).\n\nIn conclusion, the state-of-the-art approaches for both experimental measurement and DFT simulation of YH\u2082 lattice constants demonstrate that variations with stoichiometry are negligible and that the recommended DFT parameters provide a reliable and validated route for accurate computation of this critical material property.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Introduction  \\nUnderstanding the lattice constants of metal hydrides, and in particular yttrium hydride (YH\u2082), is essential for tailoring their physical and mechanical properties for applications that range from neutron moderation to advanced energy storage. The structural parameters, including lattice constants, are sensitive to hydrogen stoichiometry; thus, accurate measurements and predictions are critical. Over the years, numerous experimental studies have measured the lattice parameters using neutron diffraction, X-ray diffraction, and resonant ultrasound spectroscopy, while complementary simulation studies employing density functional theory (DFT) have provided insights into the electronic structure and corresponding mechanical properties. Many of these investigations have reported that the lattice parameters for YH\u2082 vary only modestly as the hydrogen content is changed, with typical H/Y ratios extending from as low as 1.31 up to 2.0, and a more widely studied range between approximately 1.47 and 1.96 (mehta2022amodelingand pages 2-4, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4).\\n\\nModern DFT simulations effectively reproduce experimental observations when the computational parameters are properly chosen. Notably, widely accepted settings include using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange-correlation energy, typically in its Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof (PBE) parameterization, along with a plane-wave cutoff energy of 500 eV. The Brillouin zone is sampled using a Monkhorst-Pack grid, with a common mesh size of 5\u00d75\u00d75 for these systems, although some studies have explored the impact of denser meshes (such as 7\u00d77\u00d77 or even 10\u00d710\u00d710) in particular applications (shivprasad2021thermophysicalpropertiesof pages 2-3, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 2-3).

Overview of Experimental and Simulation Results  \\nExperimental investigations into the structural properties of YH\u2082 have primarily employed diffraction techniques such as neutron diffraction and X-ray diffraction. These studies report lattice constants for yttrium hydride over hydrogen-to-yttrium ratios typically spanning from 1.47 to 1.96. In one set of studies, the diffraction results indicate that the lattice parameters exhibit minimal changes with varying stoichiometry. For example, measurements made via neutron diffraction have demonstrated that the lattice constant remains nearly constant across different H/Y ratios, with only a slight increase observed when a hydrogen vacancy is present or as the temperature changes (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 6-7).\\n\\nSome reports provide direct comparisons between DFT simulation results and experimental data. In several instances, the DFT-calculated lattice parameters for stoichiometric YH\u2082 were found to overestimate the experimentally measured values by approximately 0.01 \u00c5. One study, for instance, reported experimental values of a = b \u2248 3.667 \u00c5 and c \u2248 5.793 \u00c5 obtained from neutron diffraction, while DFT computations yielded a = b \u2248 3.658 \u00c5 and c \u2248 5.677 \u00c5 (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 7-9). This close agreement indicates that the DFT method\u2014when implemented with properly chosen simulation parameters\u2014is robust in its predictive capability. In addition, the variations of the lattice constant as a function of the H/Y ratio have been quantified; for example, one analysis found a variation slope of approximately \u22120.0055 \u00c5 per unit increase in the H/Y ratio, and another highlighted an overall change of only about 0.004 \u00c5 for ratios ranging from 1.31 to 2.0 (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 6-7, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 1-2).\\n\\nMoreover, complementary simulation studies have reported that the density of YH\u2082 predicted by DFT is approximately 4.26 g/cm\u00b3, which is in very close proximity to the experimental value of around 4.30 g/cm\u00b3 (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 7-9). Such consistency between experimental measures and DFT predictions underscores the validity of the computational approach and the selected parameters, and it reinforces the confidence in applying these techniques to explore subtle structural variations induced by stoichiometric changes (shivprasad2021thermophysicalpropertiesof pages 2-3).\\n\\n3. Density Functional Theory Methodology for Lattice Constant Calculation  \\nDensity functional theory has emerged as a powerful tool for predicting the structural and electronic properties of materials, including lattice constants, with a high degree of accuracy. In the context of YH\u2082, the reliability of DFT hinges on the careful selection of simulation parameters. The following subsections detail the methodology, starting from the choice of exchange-correlation functional to the convergence criteria employed in the calculations.\\n\\n3.1 Exchange-Correlation Functional and Pseudopotentials  \\nThe most widely used approach in DFT calculations for YH\u2082 is based on the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange-correlation functional. In nearly all the studies reviewed, the Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof (PBE) formulation of the GGA has been adopted because it reliably produces accurate lattice parameters and mechanical properties (mehta2022amodelingand pages 2-4, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4). This functional has been validated against experimental data and is known to capture the essential physics underlying the bonding interactions between yttrium and hydrogen atoms. Furthermore, several investigations have utilized Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) pseudopotentials to represent the core electrons of yttrium and hydrogen accurately. The PAW method is particularly effective because it combines the accuracy of all-electron calculations with the computational efficiency of pseudopotentials, ensuring that the computed lattice parameters are not compromised by an inadequate description of the ionic cores (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4).\\n\\n3.2 Plane-Wave Basis Set and Cutoff Energy  \\nIn plane-wave DFT calculations, the accuracy of the computed wavefunctions depends on the plane-wave cutoff energy. For YH\u2082, extensive studies have converged on a cutoff energy of 500 eV as being sufficient to accurately describe the electron density and total energy of the system (mehta2022amodelingand pages 2-4, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4). A cutoff of 500 eV is high enough to ensure that basis-set incompleteness errors are minimized, while still remaining computationally tractable. This choice has been validated by comparison with experimental lattice constants and is further supported by additional simulation efforts that report consistent values across diverse stoichiometries (shivprasad2021thermophysicalpropertiesof pages 2-3, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 2-3).\\n\\n3.3 k-Point Sampling in the Brillouin Zone  \\nAnother critical factor influencing the accuracy of DFT calculations is the sampling of the Brillouin zone via the k-point mesh. In the studies under review, a Monkhorst-Pack grid of 5\u00d75\u00d75 is the most commonly employed configuration (mehta2022amodelingand pages 2-4, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4). This mesh provides a balanced trade-off between computational efficiency and precision in the evaluation of the electronic states. Although a denser k-mesh (e.g., 7\u00d77\u00d77 or 10\u00d710\u00d710) has been explored in some cases, particularly when investigating mechanical properties or subtle electronic features, the 5\u00d75\u00d75 grid remains the validated standard for lattice constant calculations, ensuring that the total energy is converged to within approximately 1 meV per atom (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 2-3).\\n\\n3.4 Convergence Criteria and Supercell Considerations  \\nHigh-precision DFT calculations further depend on stringent convergence criteria. Several studies have adopted electronic convergence thresholds on the order of 10^(-6) eV and ionic convergence criteria of approximately 10^(-5) eV to ensure that the computed lattice constants are not affected by numerical errors (shivprasad2021thermophysicalpropertiesof pages 2-3). In addition, some investigations have considered supercell approaches\u2014using supercells containing up to 96 atoms\u2014particularly when performing temperature-dependent calculations or when analyzing defect structures and hydrogen vacancies. These supercell calculations have provided additional insights into the minimal variation of lattice constants with stoichiometry and the stabilization mechanisms provided by hydrogen occupying tetrahedral sites in the crystal lattice (chapman2020thermalneutronscattering pages 18-20, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 1-2).\\n\\n3.5 Implementation in VASP  \\nThe implementation of the methodological framework is typically carried out using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP), which has become the de facto standard for first-principles calculations on transition metal hydrides. VASP enables the practical application of the aforementioned established DFT parameters and has been instrumental in validating the lattice constants of YH\u2082 against experimental benchmarks. In the studies reviewed, VASP simulations employing GGA-PBE, a 500 eV plane-wave cutoff, PAW pseudopotentials, and a 5\u00d75\u00d75 k-point mesh consistently yielded lattice constants that deviated by only 0.01 \u00c5 from neutron diffraction measurements (mehta2022amodelingand pages 2-4).\\n\\n4. Results and Comparative Analysis  \\nIn this section, we present a detailed comparative analysis of the lattice constants of YH\u2082 as reported by experimental and simulation studies. A key finding across multiple reports is that the lattice parameters for YH\u2082 are remarkably robust with respect to changes in hydrogen stoichiometry, with only minimal variations observed even when the H/Y ratio is altered over a wide range.\\n\\n4.1 Experimental Measurement of Lattice Constants  \\nExperimental determinations of lattice constants for YH\u2082 have been conducted using neutron diffraction, X-ray diffraction, and Rietveld refinement techniques. For stoichiometric YH\u2082, neutron diffraction measurements have yielded lattice parameters on the order of a = b \u2248 3.667 \u00c5 and c \u2248 5.793 \u00c5. These values have been corroborated by additional X-ray diffraction studies, which typically report H/Y ratios in the range of 1.47 to 1.96 (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 2-3). In some investigations, the experimental protocols further involve sophisticated post-processing methods such as extraction refining processes to precisely determine the lattice constants. Despite slight differences between individual measurements, the general consensus is that the lattice constant remains nearly invariant with stoichiometry, with only very small expansions attributed to the formation of hydrogen vacancies (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 6-7).\\n\\n4.2 DFT Simulation of Lattice Constants  \\nDFT simulations of YH\u2082, when performed with the validated parameters, yield lattice constants that are in excellent agreement with experimental values. For instance, simulations employing a 500 eV cutoff, a 5\u00d75\u00d75 k-point mesh, and GGA-PBE with PAW pseudopotentials have produced lattice constants for stoichiometric YH\u2082 that are approximately a = b \u2248 3.658 \u00c5 and c \u2248 5.677 \u00c5. The observed discrepancy of about 0.01 \u00c5 when compared with experimental data has been attributed to intrinsic limitations inherent in the exchange-correlation functional and the fact that DFT typically assesses the system at 0 K, while experiments are conducted at ambient or elevated temperatures (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 7-9, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 6-7). Furthermore, additional simulations have highlighted that the variation in lattice constants with changes in the H/Y ratio is minimal, with the DFT results indicating changes on the order of only 0.004 \u00c5 across stoichiometries between 1.31 and 2.0 (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 1-2). Such subtle changes are quantitatively captured through a slope of approximately \u22120.0055 \u00c5 per unit change in the H/Y ratio, emphasizing that the structural framework of YH\u2082 remains highly robust despite stoichiometric modification (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 6-7).\\n\\n4.3 Comparison of Experimental and Simulation Data  \\nA detailed comparison of the experimental and computational results reveals a striking consistency between the two approaches. On one hand, experimental measurements consistently yield lattice parameters that are only marginally different from those predicted by DFT when employing the standard set of parameters. On the other hand, simulation studies benefit from the ability to explore the influence of defects, temperature, and bonding states on the lattice constant in a controlled manner. For example, density functional theory calculations have provided further insights into the effect of hydrogen vacancies, where the introduction of vacancies in the stoichiometric YH\u2082 lattice creates only a slight lattice expansion, a phenomenon also observed in neutron diffraction studies (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 6-7).\\n\\nIn addition to lattice constants, the computed density of YH\u2082 has been a benchmark for assessing the accuracy of the simulations. DFT calculations have yielded a density of approximately 4.26 g/cm\u00b3, which is in excellent agreement with experimental determinations of around 4.30 g/cm\u00b3 (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 7-9). This close match reinforces the notion that the DFT methods, when implemented with the recommended parameters, are highly reliable not only for the prediction of lattice parameters but also for the estimation of other structural properties.\\n\\n5. Discussion  \\nThe excellent agreement between experimental lattice constants and DFT predictions for YH\u2082 is a testament to the maturity of both the experimental techniques and computational methods employed in this field. The successful application of DFT in calculating structural parameters for YH\u2082 can be attributed to several factors, the foremost being the selection of a robust exchange-correlation functional (i.e., GGA-PBE), which is widely recognized for its ability to capture the essential physics of transition metal hydrides (mehta2022amodelingand pages 2-4, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4).\\n\\nThe use of a plane-wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 500 eV has proven sufficient to achieve convergence in the total energy and electronic density, thereby ensuring that the computational predictions of the lattice constant are not significantly affected by the limits of the basis set (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4, shivprasad2021thermophysicalpropertiesof pages 2-3). Likewise, the employment of a 5\u00d75\u00d75 Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid provides an optimal balance between computational cost and accuracy, as demonstrated by the slight deviations (on the order of 0.01 \u00c5) observed when comparing DFT results with experimental values (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 2-3).\\n\\nIt is also noteworthy that some studies have explored the impact of temperature on the lattice constant. In these investigations, it was found that DFT calculations\u2014typically performed at 0 K\u2014tend to overpredict the lattice constant by a small margin (approximately 0.2%) relative to high-temperature neutron diffraction experiments (mehta2022amodelingand pages 5-10). Such discrepancies are not only within acceptable limits but also highlight the intrinsic differences between static zero-Kelvin calculations and experiments performed at finite temperatures, where thermal expansion effects become significant.\\n\\nThe subtle variations of lattice constants with changes in stoichiometry, whether due to slight differences in the H/Y ratio or the formation of hydrogen vacancies, are captured with remarkable precision in DFT simulations. The finding that the lattice constant changes by only about 0.004 \u00c5 across a broad range of stoichiometries (from 1.31 to 2.0) emphasizes the structural robustness of the YH\u2082 lattice and suggests that the material\u2019s mechanical and thermodynamic properties are largely insensitive to modest deviations in hydrogen content (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 1-2, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 6-7). Moreover, the observation that hydrogen preferentially occupies tetrahedral sites in the lattice\u2014as revealed through defect analysis in DFT studies\u2014provides a microscopic explanation for the minimal expansion observed experimentally (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 6-7).\\n\\nA noteworthy point in the discussion is the occasional variation in the k-point grid size observed in the literature. While the 5\u00d75\u00d75 mesh is the most frequently adopted setup, some works have employed a 7\u00d77\u00d77 grid or even a denser 10\u00d710\u00d710 mesh when investigating other properties such as elastic constants or phonon dispersion relations (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4, li2014mechanicalandthermodynamic pages 1-3). These variations, however, do not significantly alter the computed lattice parameters, reaffirming that the standard parameters remain robust across different physical contexts and that any minor discrepancies fall within the expected error margins of DFT calculations.\\n\\nIn addition, the careful choice of convergence criteria (with electronic convergence on the order of 10^(-6) eV and ionic convergence of 10^(-5) eV) has been critical in ensuring that the computed lattice constants are not influenced by numerical uncertainties (shivprasad2021thermophysicalpropertiesof pages 2-3). The high level of precision achieved in these simulations is essential when making direct comparisons with experimentally measured values, where even differences of a few thousandths of an angstrom can be significant for subsequent applications or for validating theoretical models.\\n\\nFinally, the implementation of these DFT protocols using VASP has not only provided reliable computational predictions but also enabled systematic studies of the effect of temperature, pressure, and stoichiometry on the structural properties of YH\u2082. The widespread adoption of these protocols across multiple studies lends further credence to their validity and highlights the continuing importance of DFT in the materials science community.\\n\\n6. Conclusions  \\nIn summary, a comprehensive analysis of both experimental and simulation results for the lattice constants of yttrium hydride (YH\u2082) reveals a high level of agreement between the two. Experimental studies employing neutron and X-ray diffraction consistently report lattice constants that vary very little with hydrogen stoichiometry, with typical H/Y ratios in the range of approximately 1.47 to 1.96, and in some cases extending from 1.31 to 2.0. DFT simulations, when performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) with a validated set of parameters\u2014that is, the use of the GGA-PBE exchange-correlation functional, PAW pseudopotentials, a plane-wave cutoff energy of 500 eV, and a 5\u00d75\u00d75 Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh\u2014yield lattice constants that differ from experimental values by only about 0.01 \u00c5. This minor deviation is attributed primarily to the inherent approximations of the DFT method and the zero-Kelvin nature of the simulations. It is also noted that DFT calculations predict a slight overestimation of the lattice constant (by approximately 0.2%) compared to high-temperature neutron diffraction measurements, a trend that is well understood in the context of thermal expansion effects.\\n\\nFurthermore, both experimental and computational studies confirm that the lattice constant of YH\u2082 is remarkably insensitive to changes in hydrogen stoichiometry, with variations on the order of 0.004 \u00c5 being observed across a broad range of H/Y ratios. The subtle variations\u2014quantified by a slope of roughly \u22120.0055 \u00c5 per unit change in the H/Y ratio\u2014emphasize the robust structural framework of YH\u2082, which remains largely unaffected by moderate deviations in hydrogen content. In addition to the lattice constant, the density values predicted by DFT (approximately 4.26 g/cm\u00b3) are in excellent agreement with experimental measurements (~4.30 g/cm\u00b3), further validating the chosen computational approach.\\n\\nOverall, the compiled evidence from multiple studies underscores that the recommended DFT parameters (GGA-PBE, 500 eV cutoff, 5\u00d75\u00d75 k-point mesh, and PAW pseudopotentials) are not only validated by direct comparisons with experimental data but are also robust in predicting the structural properties of YH\u2082 across a wide range of stoichiometries. These findings provide a firm basis for future exploratory studies and practical applications involving yttrium hydride, as researchers can be confident in the accuracy and reliability of the computational framework outlined herein (mehta2022amodelingand pages 2-4, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4, shivprasad2021thermophysicalpropertiesof pages 2-3, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 2-3, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 6-7, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 7-9, li2014mechanicalandthermodynamic pages 1-3, mehta2022amodelingand pages 5-10, chapman2020thermalneutronscattering pages 18-20, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 1-2).\\n\\nIn conclusion, the state-of-the-art approaches for both experimental measurement and DFT simulation of YH\u2082 lattice constants demonstrate that variations with stoichiometry are negligible and that the recommended DFT parameters provide a reliable and validated route for accurate computation of this critical material property.\",\"formatted_answer\":\"Question: What are the previously reported experimental and simulation results for the lattice constants of yttrium hydride (YH\u2082) with different stoichiometries, and how can the lattice constant be computed using density functional theory (DFT)?

The compiled evidence indicates that the chosen parameters lead to highly reliable predictions with minor deviations (typically on the order of 0.01 \u00c5) from the corresponding experimental measurements.\\n\\n1. Introduction  \\nUnderstanding the lattice constants of metal hydrides, and in particular yttrium hydride (YH\u2082), is essential for tailoring their physical and mechanical properties for applications that range from neutron moderation to advanced energy storage. The structural parameters, including lattice constants, are sensitive to hydrogen stoichiometry; thus, accurate measurements and predictions are critical. Over the years, numerous experimental studies have measured the lattice parameters using neutron diffraction, X-ray diffraction, and resonant ultrasound spectroscopy, while complementary simulation studies employing density functional theory (DFT) have provided insights into the electronic structure and corresponding mechanical properties. Many of these investigations have reported that the lattice parameters for YH\u2082 vary only modestly as the hydrogen content is changed, with typical H/Y ratios extending from as low as 1.31 up to 2.0, and a more widely studied range between approximately 1.47 and 1.96 (mehta2022amodelingand pages 2-4, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4).\\n\\nModern DFT simulations effectively reproduce experimental observations when the computational parameters are properly chosen. Notably, widely accepted settings include using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange-correlation energy, typically in its Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof (PBE) parameterization, along with a plane-wave cutoff energy of 500 eV. The Brillouin zone is sampled using a Monkhorst-Pack grid, with a common mesh size of 5\u00d75\u00d75 for these systems, although some studies have explored the impact of denser meshes (such as 7\u00d77\u00d77 or even 10\u00d710\u00d710) in particular applications (shivprasad2021thermophysicalpropertiesof pages 2-3, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 2-3).

Results and Comparative Analysis  \\nIn this section, we present a detailed comparative analysis of the lattice constants of YH\u2082 as reported by experimental and simulation studies. A key finding across multiple reports is that the lattice parameters for YH\u2082 are remarkably robust with respect to changes in hydrogen stoichiometry, with only minimal variations observed even when the H/Y ratio is altered over a wide range.\\n\\n4.1 Experimental Measurement of Lattice Constants  \\nExperimental determinations of lattice constants for YH\u2082 have been conducted using neutron diffraction, X-ray diffraction, and Rietveld refinement techniques. For stoichiometric YH\u2082, neutron diffraction measurements have yielded lattice parameters on the order of a = b \u2248 3.667 \u00c5 and c \u2248 5.793 \u00c5. These values have been corroborated by additional X-ray diffraction studies, which typically report H/Y ratios in the range of 1.47 to 1.96 (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 2-3). In some investigations, the experimental protocols further involve sophisticated post-processing methods such as extraction refining processes to precisely determine the lattice constants. Despite slight differences between individual measurements, the general consensus is that the lattice constant remains nearly invariant with stoichiometry, with only very small expansions attributed to the formation of hydrogen vacancies (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 6-7).\\n\\n4.2 DFT Simulation of Lattice Constants  \\nDFT simulations of YH\u2082, when performed with the validated parameters, yield lattice constants that are in excellent agreement with experimental values. For instance, simulations employing a 500 eV cutoff, a 5\u00d75\u00d75 k-point mesh, and GGA-PBE with PAW pseudopotentials have produced lattice constants for stoichiometric YH\u2082 that are approximately a = b \u2248 3.658 \u00c5 and c \u2248 5.677 \u00c5. The observed discrepancy of about 0.01 \u00c5 when compared with experimental data has been attributed to intrinsic limitations inherent in the exchange-correlation functional and the fact that DFT typically assesses the system at 0 K, while experiments are conducted at ambient or elevated temperatures (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 7-9, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 6-7). Furthermore, additional simulations have highlighted that the variation in lattice constants with changes in the H/Y ratio is minimal, with the DFT results indicating changes on the order of only 0.004 \u00c5 across stoichiometries between 1.31 and 2.0 (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 1-2). Such subtle changes are quantitatively captured through a slope of approximately \u22120.0055 \u00c5 per unit change in the H/Y ratio, emphasizing that the structural framework of YH\u2082 remains highly robust despite stoichiometric modification (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 6-7).\\n\\n4.3 Comparison of Experimental and Simulation Data  \\nA detailed comparison of the experimental and computational results reveals a striking consistency between the two approaches. On one hand, experimental measurements consistently yield lattice parameters that are only marginally different from those predicted by DFT when employing the standard set of parameters. On the other hand, simulation studies benefit from the ability to explore the influence of defects, temperature, and bonding states on the lattice constant in a controlled manner. For example, density functional theory calculations have provided further insights into the effect of hydrogen vacancies, where the introduction of vacancies in the stoichiometric YH\u2082 lattice creates only a slight lattice expansion, a phenomenon also observed in neutron diffraction studies (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 6-7).\\n\\nIn addition to lattice constants, the computed density of YH\u2082 has been a benchmark for assessing the accuracy of the simulations. DFT calculations have yielded a density of approximately 4.26 g/cm\u00b3, which is in excellent agreement with experimental determinations of around 4.30 g/cm\u00b3 (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 7-9). This close match reinforces the notion that the DFT methods, when implemented with the recommended parameters, are highly reliable not only for the prediction of lattice parameters but also for the estimation of other structural properties.\\n\\n5. Discussion  \\nThe excellent agreement between experimental lattice constants and DFT predictions for YH\u2082 is a testament to the maturity of both the experimental techniques and computational methods employed in this field. The successful application of DFT in calculating structural parameters for YH\u2082 can be attributed to several factors, the foremost being the selection of a robust exchange-correlation functional (i.e., GGA-PBE), which is widely recognized for its ability to capture the essential physics of transition metal hydrides (mehta2022amodelingand pages 2-4, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4).\\n\\nThe use of a plane-wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 500 eV has proven sufficient to achieve convergence in the total energy and electronic density, thereby ensuring that the computational predictions of the lattice constant are not significantly affected by the limits of the basis set (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4, shivprasad2021thermophysicalpropertiesof pages 2-3). Likewise, the employment of a 5\u00d75\u00d75 Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid provides an optimal balance between computational cost and accuracy, as demonstrated by the slight deviations (on the order of 0.01 \u00c5) observed when comparing DFT results with experimental values (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 2-3).\\n\\nIt is also noteworthy that some studies have explored the impact of temperature on the lattice constant. In these investigations, it was found that DFT calculations\u2014typically performed at 0 K\u2014tend to overpredict the lattice constant by a small margin (approximately 0.2%) relative to high-temperature neutron diffraction experiments (mehta2022amodelingand pages 5-10). Such discrepancies are not only within acceptable limits but also highlight the intrinsic differences between static zero-Kelvin calculations and experiments performed at finite temperatures, where thermal expansion effects become significant.\\n\\nThe subtle variations of lattice constants with changes in stoichiometry, whether due to slight differences in the H/Y ratio or the formation of hydrogen vacancies, are captured with remarkable precision in DFT simulations. The finding that the lattice constant changes by only about 0.004 \u00c5 across a broad range of stoichiometries (from 1.31 to 2.0) emphasizes the structural robustness of the YH\u2082 lattice and suggests that the material\u2019s mechanical and thermodynamic properties are largely insensitive to modest deviations in hydrogen content (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 1-2, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 6-7). Moreover, the observation that hydrogen preferentially occupies tetrahedral sites in the lattice\u2014as revealed through defect analysis in DFT studies\u2014provides a microscopic explanation for the minimal expansion observed experimentally (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 6-7).\\n\\nA noteworthy point in the discussion is the occasional variation in the k-point grid size observed in the literature. While the 5\u00d75\u00d75 mesh is the most frequently adopted setup, some works have employed a 7\u00d77\u00d77 grid or even a denser 10\u00d710\u00d710 mesh when investigating other properties such as elastic constants or phonon dispersion relations (mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4, li2014mechanicalandthermodynamic pages 1-3). These variations, however, do not significantly alter the computed lattice parameters, reaffirming that the standard parameters remain robust across different physical contexts and that any minor discrepancies fall within the expected error margins of DFT calculations.\\n\\nIn addition, the careful choice of convergence criteria (with electronic convergence on the order of 10^(-6) eV and ionic convergence of 10^(-5) eV) has been critical in ensuring that the computed lattice constants are not influenced by numerical uncertainties (shivprasad2021thermophysicalpropertiesof pages 2-3). The high level of precision achieved in these simulations is essential when making direct comparisons with experimentally measured values, where even differences of a few thousandths of an angstrom can be significant for subsequent applications or for validating theoretical models.\\n\\nFinally, the implementation of these DFT protocols using VASP has not only provided reliable computational predictions but also enabled systematic studies of the effect of temperature, pressure, and stoichiometry on the structural properties of YH\u2082. The widespread adoption of these protocols across multiple studies lends further credence to their validity and highlights the continuing importance of DFT in the materials science community.\\n\\n6. Conclusions  \\nIn summary, a comprehensive analysis of both experimental and simulation results for the lattice constants of yttrium hydride (YH\u2082) reveals a high level of agreement between the two. Experimental studies employing neutron and X-ray diffraction consistently report lattice constants that vary very little with hydrogen stoichiometry, with typical H/Y ratios in the range of approximately 1.47 to 1.96, and in some cases extending from 1.31 to 2.0. DFT simulations, when performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) with a validated set of parameters\u2014that is, the use of the GGA-PBE exchange-correlation functional, PAW pseudopotentials, a plane-wave cutoff energy of 500 eV, and a 5\u00d75\u00d75 Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh\u2014yield lattice constants that differ from experimental values by only about 0.01 \u00c5. This minor deviation is attributed primarily to the inherent approximations of the DFT method and the zero-Kelvin nature of the simulations. It is also noted that DFT calculations predict a slight overestimation of the lattice constant (by approximately 0.2%) compared to high-temperature neutron diffraction measurements, a trend that is well understood in the context of thermal expansion effects.\\n\\nFurthermore, both experimental and computational studies confirm that the lattice constant of YH\u2082 is remarkably insensitive to changes in hydrogen stoichiometry, with variations on the order of 0.004 \u00c5 being observed across a broad range of H/Y ratios. The subtle variations\u2014quantified by a slope of roughly \u22120.0055 \u00c5 per unit change in the H/Y ratio\u2014emphasize the robust structural framework of YH\u2082, which remains largely unaffected by moderate deviations in hydrogen content. In addition to the lattice constant, the density values predicted by DFT (approximately 4.26 g/cm\u00b3) are in excellent agreement with experimental measurements (~4.30 g/cm\u00b3), further validating the chosen computational approach.\\n\\nOverall, the compiled evidence from multiple studies underscores that the recommended DFT parameters (GGA-PBE, 500 eV cutoff, 5\u00d75\u00d75 k-point mesh, and PAW pseudopotentials) are not only validated by direct comparisons with experimental data but are also robust in predicting the structural properties of YH\u2082 across a wide range of stoichiometries. These findings provide a firm basis for future exploratory studies and practical applications involving yttrium hydride, as researchers can be confident in the accuracy and reliability of the computational framework outlined herein (mehta2022amodelingand pages 2-4, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 3-4, shivprasad2021thermophysicalpropertiesof pages 2-3, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 2-3, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 6-7, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 7-9, li2014mechanicalandthermodynamic pages 1-3, mehta2022amodelingand pages 5-10, chapman2020thermalneutronscattering pages 18-20, mehta2021adensityfunctional pages 1-2).\\n\\nIn conclusion, the state-of-the-art approaches for both experimental measurement and DFT simulation of YH\u2082 lattice constants demonstrate that variations with stoichiometry are negligible and that the recommended DFT parameters provide a reliable and validated route for accurate computation of this critical material property.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

    "formatted_answer": "Question: What are the previously reported values for the lattice constant of platinum (Pt) from both experimental measurements and computational simulations, and how can this property be accurately computed using density functional theory (DFT)? Please include validated and recommended DFT parameters such as exchange-correlation functional, k-point mesh, plane-wave cutoff energy, and any relevant convergence criteria.\n\nThis report provides a comprehensive analysis of the reported lattice constant of platinum (Pt) based on both experimental measurements and density functional theory (DFT) simulations. Platinum is widely used in catalytic, electronic, and structural applications, and its performance critically depends on its atomic structure. In particular, the lattice constant is a key parameter that not only affects the bulk modulus and cohesive energy but also influences surface reactivity and electronic properties. An accurate understanding of this constant is vital for predictive materials design. In what follows, we review the experimental consensus as well as the outcomes of various computational studies, and we detail the recommended DFT parameters\u2014including exchange\u2013correlation functionals, k\u2013point meshes, plane\u2013wave cutoff energies, and convergence criteria\u2014that are necessary for accurate DFT predictions of platinum\u2019s equilibrium lattice constant.\n\nI. Introduction  \nThe quest for a precise determination of platinum\u2019s lattice constant has spanned decades of experimental and theoretical research. Experimentally, high-resolution techniques such as X-ray diffraction and dilatometry have established the value with a very high degree of precision. Computationally, DFT has emerged as the tool of choice for predicting not only the lattice constant itself but also other derived mechanical and electronic properties. However, the accuracy of DFT predictions depends critically on the careful selection of key parameters, notably the exchange\u2013correlation functional, the density of k\u2013point sampling in the Brillouin zone, the plane\u2013wave cutoff energy, and the convergence criteria applied to the self-consistent field (SCF) procedure. The following sections elaborate on the experimental findings and the theoretical techniques that have been used to determine the lattice constant of platinum, discussing both the inherent challenges and the strategies employed to overcome them.\n\nII. Experimental Measurements of the Platinum Lattice Constant  \nA broad range of experimental investigations have reported highly convergent values for the lattice constant of platinum. Early work conducted by Van Arkel, Stenzel, Weerts, Owen, Yates, Moeller, Esch, Schneider, Goldschmidt, Land, Grube, Swanson, Tatge, Kidron, Evans, Fischer, Schroder, Waseda, Hirata, Ohtani, Stankus, and Khairulin found values ranging from 0.39223\u2005nm to 0.39244\u2005nm (arblaster1997crystallographicpropertiesof pages 3-6). When converted to angstroms, these figures correspond approximately to 3.9223\u2005\u00c5 to 3.9244\u2005\u00c5, which establishes a narrow window of uncertainty for pure platinum at room temperature. Other experimental studies, including those that report the lattice constant as 3.92\u2005\u00c5, further reinforce the reliability of these measurements (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8, ankudinov2002sensitivityofpt pages 6-7). In addition, ASTM standards, along with subsequent investigations by Evans, Fischer, and collaborators, have converged on a consensus value of 3.9231\u2005\u00c5 with extremely low uncertainty (on the order of \u00b10.0003\u2005\u00c5) (evans1972thedeterminationof pages 4-8, wasserman1972onthedetermination pages 1-4). It is also noteworthy that some studies report the lattice constant in atomic units\u2014for example, Beckstein and colleagues have reported an experimental value of 7.415\u2005a.u., which, when converted using the standard conversion factor (1\u2005a.u. = 0.529177\u2005\u00c5), is equivalent to approximately 3.92\u2005\u00c5 (beckstein2001firstprincipleselasticconstants pages 11-14). While certain investigations\u2014especially those involving alloys or samples subjected to extreme conditions\u2014have yielded lattice constant values ranging from as low as 3.52\u2005\u00c5 to as high as 3.97\u2005\u00c5 (zhang2020hydrogenadsorptionon pages 6-11), these deviations are typically associated with compositional variations or nonambient experimental conditions rather than with any intrinsic uncertainty in the lattice constant of pure platinum. Thus, the experimental data set provides a robust benchmark, indicating that the equilibrium lattice constant of pure platinum is consistently near 3.92\u2005\u00c5.\n\nIII. Computational Predictions of the Platinum Lattice Constant  \nDensity functional theory has been applied extensively to predict the lattice constant of platinum. The computational results, however, demonstrate a marked sensitivity to the choice of exchange\u2013correlation functional and other numerical parameters. In particular, DFT studies employing the Local Density Approximation (LDA) with the Vosko\u2013Wilk\u2013Nusair (VWN) correlation functional consistently yield lattice constants that closely match the experimental benchmark of approximately 3.92\u2005\u00c5 (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). In contrast, simulations that utilize Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) functionals\u2014such as the Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof (PBE), BPW91, and BLYP functionals\u2014tend to predict slightly larger lattice constants, with reported values typically falling in the range of 3.96\u2005\u00c5 to 4.00\u2005\u00c5 (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). \n\nSeveral studies have specifically employed the Gaussian and Plane Wave (GPW) formalism to evaluate platinum\u2019s equilibrium lattice constant. In these investigations, the computed lattice constant shows a subtle dependence on the size of the supercell used in the simulations. For instance, a 3\u00d73\u00d73 supercell yields a lattice constant of about 3.955\u2005\u00c5, whereas larger supercells (4\u00d74\u00d74, 5\u00d75\u00d75, or 6\u00d76\u00d76) converge to approximately 3.965\u2005\u00c5 (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8, santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 8-9). Alternative methodologies, such as full\u2013potential linearized augmented plane\u2013wave (FP-LAPW) methods, have produced lattice constant values that are marginally higher, generally ranging from 3.970\u2005\u00c5 to 3.980\u2005\u00c5. Additionally, methods based on the CO\u2013LCAO approach have yielded lattice constants of up to 3.990\u2005\u00c5. These variations underscore the well-known dependency of DFT-predicted structural properties on the chosen exchange\u2013correlation treatment and basis set completeness. It is clear from the literature that while the LDA/VWN approach offers excellent agreement with experiment, GGA-based methods introduce a modest expansion of the unit cell that can lead to overestimations of the lattice constant.\n\nIV. Recommended DFT Parameters for Accurate Lattice Constant Computations  \nA critical requirement for achieving accurate DFT predictions of the platinum lattice constant lies in the careful selection and optimization of computational parameters. The following subsections detail the recommended choices and best practices based on the available literature.\n\nA. Exchange\u2013Correlation Functional  \nThe exchange\u2013correlation functional is one of the most decisive parameters influencing the predicted lattice constant. Empirical evidence from several studies supports the use of the LDA/VWN functional for bulk platinum due to its propensity to slightly contract the electron density, thereby reproducing the experimentally observed lattice constant of approximately 3.92\u2005\u00c5 (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). Although GGA functionals, such as PBE and BPW91, include gradient corrections that typically improve descriptions of electronic inhomogeneities, these corrections often result in predictions that are 0.04\u2005\u00c5 to 0.08\u2005\u00c5 larger than the experimental benchmark (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). In addition, the BLYP functional has been observed to yield even larger lattice constants and less satisfactory cohesive properties, suggesting that it may not be appropriate for the accurate modeling of the bulk properties of platinum (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). Therefore, for the purpose of determining the equilibrium lattice constant of platinum, the LDA/VWN functional is recommended, even though the use of GGA functionals may be advantageous when surface effects or gradient corrections are under consideration.\n\nB. k\u2013Point Mesh and Brillouin Zone Sampling  \nA dense and adequately converged k\u2013point mesh is essential for metallic systems like platinum, where the Fermi surface must be sampled with high resolution. Convergence studies have shown that ensuring an energy difference of less than 5\u2005meV per atom between successive k\u2013point samplings is necessary to accurately capture the electronic structure (matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39). For bulk platinum, using 56 irreducible k\u2013points has been found to be sufficient to achieve such convergence (matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39). Other studies have recommended a 72-point k\u2013mesh for bulk calculations in conjunction with a Monkhorst\u2013Pack grid, while 19 k\u2013points have been suggested for simulations of platinum slab geometries to capture surface-related effects accurately (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). The choice between these recommendations may be guided by practical considerations such as computational cost and the specific electronic features of the system under investigation.\n\nC. Plane\u2013Wave Cutoff Energy  \nThe plane\u2013wave cutoff energy determines the size of the basis set that is used to represent the electronic wave functions. For platinum, convergence studies have consistently indicated that a cutoff energy of 400\u2005eV is adequate to reduce the total energy error to below 5\u2005meV per atom (matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39). At this cutoff, the plane\u2013wave expansion is sufficiently complete to accurately represent both the localized d\u2013orbitals and the more delocalized electrons, ensuring reliable predictions of the lattice constant. Increasing the cutoff energy beyond 400\u2005eV typically results in diminishing returns, with only marginal improvements in energy convergence relative to the significant increase in computational effort.\n\nD. Convergence Criteria and Self\u2013Consistent Field (SCF) Mixing Schemes  \nAchieving robust convergence during the self\u2013consistent field iterations is of paramount importance in DFT simulations, particularly for metal systems where the density of states near the Fermi level can cause oscillatory behavior. A common practice is to require that the energy difference between successive SCF iterations falls below a threshold of 10^\u20132\u2005atomic units (au), along with ensuring that the overall change in total energy is less than 5\u2005meV per atom (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6, matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39). The use of simple but effective mixing schemes\u2014such as a two\u2013point mixing of the Kohn\u2013Sham matrices, augmented by Pulay\u2019s Direct Inversion in the Iterative Subspace (DIIS) extrapolation\u2014has been demonstrated to enhance convergence significantly by dampening oscillations in electron density (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). These convergence strategies are critical to reliably obtaining the ground state energy minimum that corresponds to the correct equilibrium lattice constant.\n\nE. Additional Computational Considerations  \nFor methods based on the full\u2013potential linearized augmented plane\u2013wave (FP-LAPW) formalism, additional parameters must be specified to ensure a high-quality basis set. Recommended settings for FP-LAPW calculations of platinum include an RKmax of 10.0 and a muffin\u2013tin radius of 2.08\u2005atomic units (a.u.), along with a uniform 16\u00d716\u00d716 Monk\u2013Pack k\u2013point mesh. These parameters have been shown to reproduce the electronic band structure of platinum with high accuracy, both with and without the inclusion of spin\u2013orbit coupling effects (sun2008latticedynamicsand pages 1-4). In the pseudopotential plane\u2013wave approach, it is essential to employ norm\u2013conserving pseudopotentials that accurately capture the behavior of the valence electrons outside the core region, thereby minimizing basis set incompleteness and reducing errors in the computed lattice constant (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 8-9, santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8). In some cases, counterpoise corrections are applied to further mitigate residual basis set superposition errors, which can be particularly relevant in systems where weak interactions are critical to the structural properties.\n\nV. Comparative Analysis between Experimental and DFT Results  \nA detailed comparison between the experimental measurements and DFT predictions reveals a high degree of consistency when appropriate parameters are applied. As discussed, the experimental consensus for pure platinum rests at approximately 3.92\u2005\u00c5 (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8, ankudinov2002sensitivityofpt pages 6-7, arblaster1997crystallographicpropertiesof pages 3-6, evans1972thedeterminationof pages 4-8). DFT studies that employ the LDA/VWN functional typically yield lattice constants in very close agreement with this experimental value, with reported figures often falling around 3.92\u2005\u00c5 (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). By contrast, DFT simulations that use GGA functionals tend to overestimate the lattice constant slightly, with computed values ranging between 3.96\u2005\u00c5 and 4.00\u2005\u00c5 (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). Studies using the GPW formalism offer further insight into the sensitivity of the computed lattice constant to the simulation cell size: small supercells (e.g., 3\u00d73\u00d73) yield values around 3.955\u2005\u00c5, while larger supercells converge to approximately 3.965\u2005\u00c5 (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8, santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 8-9). FP-LAPW methods, known for their high level of accuracy, produce values in the range of 3.970\u2005\u00c5 to 3.980\u2005\u00c5, thereby slightly exceeding the experimental value but remaining within an acceptable margin of error given the inherent approximations of the exchange\u2013correlation functional (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16). Overall, these comparisons underscore that the best agreement with experiment is obtained when using the LDA/VWN functional combined with a dense k\u2013point mesh and a plane\u2013wave cutoff energy of 400\u2005eV.\n\nVI. Discussion on Methodological Considerations and Limitations  \nDespite the apparent convergence between experimental and computational results for platinum\u2019s lattice constant, several methodological considerations warrant further discussion. One primary challenge in DFT predictions is the inherent dependency on the chosen exchange\u2013correlation functional. The LDA/VWN functional, while providing excellent convergence for the lattice constant, tends to neglect some of the subtle electron correlation effects that might influence other physical properties (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). Conversely, GGA functionals, by incorporating density-gradient corrections, introduce a slight expansion in the predicted unit cell. This systematic overestimation, typically in the order of 0.04\u20130.08\u2005\u00c5, is a well\u2013documented phenomenon that is independent of the specifics of k\u2013point sampling or cutoff energy (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). Although these deviations are relatively small, they can be significant when predicting properties that are highly sensitive to lattice spacing, such as adsorption energies on platinum surfaces or the cohesive energy in complex alloys.\n\nAnother key consideration is the choice of k\u2013point mesh and the associated convergence criteria. For metallic systems like platinum, the presence of a complex Fermi surface demands highly resolved k\u2013point integration. Several studies have demonstrated that an energy convergence threshold of 5\u2005meV per atom is necessary, with 56 irreducible k\u2013points providing a suitable balance between computational cost and accuracy (matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39). Nonetheless, alternative recommendations suggest that a denser k\u2013point grid\u2014such as 72 k\u2013points for bulk systems\u2014may further improve the convergence and reliability of the predicted lattice constant, particularly when additional electronic subtleties such as surface states are of interest (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). These recommendations highlight the need for systematic convergence testing in any DFT study to ensure that the selected parameters yield results that are both accurate and reproducible.\n\nThe plane\u2013wave cutoff energy is another critical numerical parameter. In the case of platinum, a cutoff of 400\u2005eV has been widely adopted based on extensive convergence studies (matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39). This choice ensures that the basis set is sufficiently complete to capture the full complexity of the electronic wave functions, including the localized d\u2013orbitals that are characteristic of transition metals. While increasing the cutoff energy beyond 400\u2005eV may further reduce numerical errors, the improvements are generally marginal relative to the computational expense incurred. Thus, the 400\u2005eV cutoff represents a practical compromise that has been validated across multiple studies.\n\nIn addition to these primary parameters, the selection of appropriate SCF mixing schemes plays a significant role in achieving reliable convergence. For platinum, a combination of two\u2013point mixing of the Kohn\u2013Sham matrices coupled with Pulay\u2019s DIIS has proven effective in stabilizing the iterative process, particularly when striving for an energy convergence criterion better than 10^\u20132\u2005au (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). This combination minimizes oscillatory behavior in the SCF cycle and ensures that the iterative procedure converges to the true ground state configuration. Such techniques are especially important in metallic systems, where the metallic density of states near the Fermi level can otherwise lead to pronounced numerical instabilities.\n\nFor methods employing the FP-LAPW approach, additional parameters such as the RKmax value and the muffin\u2013tin radius must be judiciously chosen to ensure an accurate representation of both the core and valence electrons. Recommended values\u2014RKmax set to 10.0 and the muffin\u2013tin radius set to 2.08\u2005a.u.\u2014have been shown to yield robust predictions for the lattice constant of platinum, with a concomitant high level of agreement with experiment (sun2008latticedynamicsand pages 1-4). Finally, the use of norm\u2013conserving pseudopotentials in the pseudopotential plane\u2013wave approach is crucial for accurately reproducing the behavior of the valence electron wave functions outside the core region. When these potentials are carefully generated and benchmarked against all\u2013electron methods, the resulting lattice constant predictions exhibit excellent agreement with both experimental data and FP-LAPW calculations (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 8-9, santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8).\n\nVII. Future Directions in DFT Simulation of Platinum  \nLooking forward, several avenues exist for further improving the accuracy of DFT simulations of platinum. Although the current state\u2013of\u2013the\u2013art parameters yield lattice constants in very close agreement with experimental values, systematic errors arising from the inherent approximations in the exchange\u2013correlation functional persist. Future research may focus on the incorporation of improved functionals that go beyond the LDA and GGA approximations to include a more accurate treatment of electron correlation and nonlocal effects. Hybrid functionals, such as PBE0 or TPSSh, which have been found to perform well for platinum\u2013containing complexes (debefve2021systematicassessmentof pages 4-4, debefve2021systematicassessmentof pages 5-7), may offer enhanced accuracy when appropriately adapted for bulk systems.  \n\nFurthermore, additional emphasis on full relativistic corrections, including the explicit inclusion of spin\u2013orbit coupling effects, may prove important for properties beyond the equilibrium lattice constant, especially given platinum\u2019s status as a heavy transition metal. While many studies have demonstrated that scalar relativistic approximations capture the dominant effects on the lattice constant (sun2008latticedynamicsand pages 1-4), more sophisticated treatments that fully incorporate spin\u2013orbit interactions may be necessary when investigating subtle electronic structure features or surface phenomena. Similarly, the integration of ab initio molecular dynamics and density functional perturbation theory to account for finite\u2013temperature effects and anharmonic vibrational contributions constitutes another promising direction for maximum predictive accuracy.\n\nMachine learning and data\u2013driven approaches are emerging as powerful tools for parameter optimization and error minimization in DFT simulations. By automatically refining k\u2013point densities, plane\u2013wave cutoff values, and pseudopotential parameters based on training data from high\u2013precision experiments, such techniques have the potential to further narrow the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements. In this context, the development of automated workflows that systematically perform convergence tests and dynamically update simulation parameters will likely be a key focus of future research in computational materials science.\n\nVIII. Integration of Computational and Experimental Methodologies  \nA salient feature of the platinum lattice constant studies is the remarkable consistency that has been achieved between experimental measurements and DFT predictions. High\u2013precision experimental techniques have established the lattice constant of pure platinum at approximately 3.92\u2005\u00c5, with outstanding reproducibility across different laboratories and measurement modalities (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8, arblaster1997crystallographicpropertiesof pages 3-6, ankudinov2002sensitivityofpt pages 6-7, evans1972thedeterminationof pages 4-8, wasserman1972onthedetermination pages 1-4). When DFT calculations employ the recommended parameters outlined above\u2014particularly the use of the LDA/VWN functional, dense k\u2013point sampling (ranging from 56 to 72 irreducible k\u2013points or equivalent Monk\u2013Pack grids), a plane\u2013wave cutoff energy of 400\u2005eV, and rigorous SCF convergence\u2014the computed equilibrium lattice constant aligns very closely with these experimental benchmarks (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6, matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39). In fact, many studies have demonstrated convergence of the DFT lattice constant to values as precise as 3.92\u2005\u00c5 when these best practices are followed rigorously.\n\nThis level of agreement between experiment and theory not only validates the theoretical methods but also provides a robust foundation for the predictive design of platinum\u2013based materials. The ability to accurately compute the lattice constant allows for reliable predictions of bulk modulus, cohesive energy, and other mechanical properties that are essential for various technological applications. Moreover, the iterative feedback between experimental measurements and computational simulations continues to be a driving force in refining both methodologies, ultimately enabling the design of platinum\u2013based catalysts, electronic devices, and alloys with tailored properties.\n\nIX. Implications for Material Properties and Applications  \nThe lattice constant of platinum, as determined by both experimental and theoretical means, plays a central role in dictating numerous material properties. For instance, the bulk modulus, a measure of a material\u2019s resistance to compression, is directly related to the equilibrium volume of the crystal and, by extension, to the lattice constant. An accurate lattice constant allows for precise computations of the bulk modulus and the cohesive energy, which are critical for evaluating the mechanical stability of platinum-based materials. In catalytic applications, even slight variations in the lattice spacing can modify the adsorption energies of reactant molecules on platinum surfaces, thereby influencing the activity and selectivity of catalytic processes. Consequently, the predictive reliability of DFT in reproducing the experimental lattice constant lends significant credence to its broader applications in materials design. \n\nAdditionally, in electronic applications, the lattice constant is a key parameter in determining the electronic band structure of metals. It affects the dispersion of energy bands and the effective mass of charge carriers, factors that in turn influence the electrical conductivity and other transport properties. Since platinum is widely used in electronic contacts and interconnects, precise knowledge of its lattice structure is essential for optimizing device performance. The consistent agreement observed between DFT predictions and experimental measurements thus instills confidence in the use of these computational methods for the design and optimization of advanced platinum\u2013based systems.\n\nX. Summary and Conclusions  \nIn summary, the body of experimental research reviewed herein consistently demonstrates that the equilibrium lattice constant of pure platinum is approximately 3.92\u2005\u00c5. Early crystallographic studies and subsequent high-precision measurements have reliably reported lattice constant values in the range of 3.922\u2005\u00c5 to 3.924\u2005\u00c5 (arblaster1997crystallographicpropertiesof pages 3-6, santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8, ankudinov2002sensitivityofpt pages 6-7, evans1972thedeterminationof pages 4-8, wasserman1972onthedetermination pages 1-4). In parallel, a wide array of DFT studies has been conducted to predict this fundamental parameter. DFT simulations that use the LDA/VWN functional have been shown to reproduce the experimental lattice constant with remarkable fidelity, yielding values around 3.92\u2005\u00c5 (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). In contrast, simulations employing GGA-type functionals tend to overestimate the lattice constant, producing values in the range of 3.96\u2005\u00c5 to 4.00\u2005\u00c5 (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). The Gaussian and Plane Wave (GPW) formalism, when applied with a careful treatment of supercell size, produces converged lattice constants of approximately 3.965\u2005\u00c5, while FP\u2013LAPW methods yield values near 3.97\u2005\u00c5 to 3.98\u2005\u00c5 (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8, santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 8-9).\n\nTo achieve these results, several key DFT parameters must be rigorously optimized. First, the choice of exchange\u2013correlation functional is paramount; the LDA/VWN functional is recommended for bulk platinum since it yields lattice constants in excellent agreement with the experimental benchmark (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). Second, the k\u2013point mesh must be sufficiently dense to resolve the metallic Fermi surface; convergence studies suggest that 56 irreducible k\u2013points are adequate for bulk systems, although some studies have employed up to 72 k\u2013points or equivalent Monk\u2013Pack grids, with slab calculations often requiring around 19 k\u2013points (matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39, kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). Third, a plane\u2013wave cutoff energy of 400\u2005eV is widely validated as sufficient to ensure convergence of the total energy to within 5\u2005meV per atom (matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39). Fourth, it is essential to apply strict convergence criteria during the SCF procedure\u2014typically an energy threshold below 10^\u20132\u2005au per iteration\u2014and to employ effective mixing schemes such as a two\u2013point mixing coupled with Pulay\u2019s DIIS to ensure rapid and stable convergence (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). Additionally, for FP\u2013LAPW calculations, setting an RKmax of 10.0 and a muffin\u2013tin radius of 2.08\u2005a.u. has been shown to yield accurate electronic structures (sun2008latticedynamicsand pages 1-4). Finally, the use of norm\u2013conserving pseudopotentials is critical in the pseudopotential approach, ensuring an accurate description of the valence electron wave functions and minimizing errors due to basis set incompleteness (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 8-9, santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8).\n\nDespite the inevitable approximations inherent in the exchange\u2013correlation functionals and the potential for numerical discretization errors, the overall consistency between experimental measurements and DFT predictions provides strong evidence for the reliability of modern computational methods for benchmarking the fundamental properties of platinum. Future improvements may involve the application of hybrid functionals, the inclusion of full relativistic effects, and the adoption of machine learning techniques for adaptive parameter optimization. Such advancements are expected to further refine the predictive capabilities of DFT, enabling even more accurate and efficient simulation of platinum and related materials.\n\nIn conclusion, the lattice constant of pure platinum is experimentally established at approximately 3.92\u2005\u00c5, and DFT simulations\u2014when executed with carefully chosen and rigorously converged parameters (such as the use of the LDA/VWN functional, a dense k\u2013point mesh with 56 to 72 irreducible k\u2013points, a plane\u2013wave cutoff energy of 400\u2005eV, and SCF convergence criteria of 5\u2005meV per atom or better)\u2014yield predictions that are in excellent agreement with this experimental benchmark (arblaster1997crystallographicpropertiesof pages 3-6, matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39, santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8, kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6, beckstein2001firstprincipleselasticconstants pages 11-14). The synergy between experimental and theoretical investigations not only reinforces the fundamental understanding of platinum\u2019s crystallographic properties but also underpins its continued technological significance in various advanced applications.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Platinum is widely used in catalytic, electronic, and structural applications, and its performance critically depends on its atomic structure. In particular, the lattice constant is a key parameter that not only affects the bulk modulus and cohesive energy but also influences surface reactivity and electronic properties. An accurate understanding of this constant is vital for predictive materials design. In what follows, we review the experimental consensus as well as the outcomes of various computational studies, and we detail the recommended DFT parameters\u2014including exchange\u2013correlation functionals, k\u2013point meshes, plane\u2013wave cutoff energies, and convergence criteria\u2014that are necessary for accurate DFT predictions of platinum\u2019s equilibrium lattice constant.\\n\\nI. Introduction  \\nThe quest for a precise determination of platinum\u2019s lattice constant has spanned decades of experimental and theoretical research. Experimentally, high-resolution techniques such as X-ray diffraction and dilatometry have established the value with a very high degree of precision. Computationally, DFT has emerged as the tool of choice for predicting not only the lattice constant itself but also other derived mechanical and electronic properties. However, the accuracy of DFT predictions depends critically on the careful selection of key parameters, notably the exchange\u2013correlation functional, the density of k\u2013point sampling in the Brillouin zone, the plane\u2013wave cutoff energy, and the convergence criteria applied to the self-consistent field (SCF) procedure. The following sections elaborate on the experimental findings and the theoretical techniques that have been used to determine the lattice constant of platinum, discussing both the inherent challenges and the strategies employed to overcome them.\\n\\nII. Experimental Measurements of the Platinum Lattice Constant  \\nA broad range of experimental investigations have reported highly convergent values for the lattice constant of platinum. Early work conducted by Van Arkel, Stenzel, Weerts, Owen, Yates, Moeller, Esch, Schneider, Goldschmidt, Land, Grube, Swanson, Tatge, Kidron, Evans, Fischer, Schroder, Waseda, Hirata, Ohtani, Stankus, and Khairulin found values ranging from 0.39223\u2005nm to 0.39244\u2005nm (arblaster1997crystallographicpropertiesof pages 3-6). When converted to angstroms, these figures correspond approximately to 3.9223\u2005\u00c5 to 3.9244\u2005\u00c5, which establishes a narrow window of uncertainty for pure platinum at room temperature. Other experimental studies, including those that report the lattice constant as 3.92\u2005\u00c5, further reinforce the reliability of these measurements (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8, ankudinov2002sensitivityofpt pages 6-7). In addition, ASTM standards, along with subsequent investigations by Evans, Fischer, and collaborators, have converged on a consensus value of 3.9231\u2005\u00c5 with extremely low uncertainty (on the order of \u00b10.0003\u2005\u00c5) (evans1972thedeterminationof pages 4-8, wasserman1972onthedetermination pages 1-4). It is also noteworthy that some studies report the lattice constant in atomic units\u2014for example, Beckstein and colleagues have reported an experimental value of 7.415\u2005a.u., which, when converted using the standard conversion factor (1\u2005a.u. = 0.529177\u2005\u00c5), is equivalent to approximately 3.92\u2005\u00c5 (beckstein2001firstprincipleselasticconstants pages 11-14). While certain investigations\u2014especially those involving alloys or samples subjected to extreme conditions\u2014have yielded lattice constant values ranging from as low as 3.52\u2005\u00c5 to as high as 3.97\u2005\u00c5 (zhang2020hydrogenadsorptionon pages 6-11), these deviations are typically associated with compositional variations or nonambient experimental conditions rather than with any intrinsic uncertainty in the lattice constant of pure platinum. Thus, the experimental data set provides a robust benchmark, indicating that the equilibrium lattice constant of pure platinum is consistently near 3.92\u2005\u00c5.\\n\\nIII. Computational Predictions of the Platinum Lattice Constant  \\nDensity functional theory has been applied extensively to predict the lattice constant of platinum. The computational results, however, demonstrate a marked sensitivity to the choice of exchange\u2013correlation functional and other numerical parameters. In particular, DFT studies employing the Local Density Approximation (LDA) with the Vosko\u2013Wilk\u2013Nusair (VWN) correlation functional consistently yield lattice constants that closely match the experimental benchmark of approximately 3.92\u2005\u00c5 (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). In contrast, simulations that utilize Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) functionals\u2014such as the Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof (PBE), BPW91, and BLYP functionals\u2014tend to predict slightly larger lattice constants, with reported values typically falling in the range of 3.96\u2005\u00c5 to 4.00\u2005\u00c5 (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). \\n\\nSeveral studies have specifically employed the Gaussian and Plane Wave (GPW) formalism to evaluate platinum\u2019s equilibrium lattice constant. In these investigations, the computed lattice constant shows a subtle dependence on the size of the supercell used in the simulations. For instance, a 3\u00d73\u00d73 supercell yields a lattice constant of about 3.955\u2005\u00c5, whereas larger supercells (4\u00d74\u00d74, 5\u00d75\u00d75, or 6\u00d76\u00d76) converge to approximately 3.965\u2005\u00c5 (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8, santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 8-9). Alternative methodologies, such as full\u2013potential linearized augmented plane\u2013wave (FP-LAPW) methods, have produced lattice constant values that are marginally higher, generally ranging from 3.970\u2005\u00c5 to 3.980\u2005\u00c5. Additionally, methods based on the CO\u2013LCAO approach have yielded lattice constants of up to 3.990\u2005\u00c5. These variations underscore the well-known dependency of DFT-predicted structural properties on the chosen exchange\u2013correlation treatment and basis set completeness. It is clear from the literature that while the LDA/VWN approach offers excellent agreement with experiment, GGA-based methods introduce a modest expansion of the unit cell that can lead to overestimations of the lattice constant.\\n\\nIV. Recommended DFT Parameters for Accurate Lattice Constant Computations  \\nA critical requirement for achieving accurate DFT predictions of the platinum lattice constant lies in the careful selection and optimization of computational parameters. The following subsections detail the recommended choices and best practices based on the available literature.\\n\\nA. Exchange\u2013Correlation Functional  \\nThe exchange\u2013correlation functional is one of the most decisive parameters influencing the predicted lattice constant. Empirical evidence from several studies supports the use of the LDA/VWN functional for bulk platinum due to its propensity to slightly contract the electron density, thereby reproducing the experimentally observed lattice constant of approximately 3.92\u2005\u00c5 (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). Although GGA functionals, such as PBE and BPW91, include gradient corrections that typically improve descriptions of electronic inhomogeneities, these corrections often result in predictions that are 0.04\u2005\u00c5 to 0.08\u2005\u00c5 larger than the experimental benchmark (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). In addition, the BLYP functional has been observed to yield even larger lattice constants and less satisfactory cohesive properties, suggesting that it may not be appropriate for the accurate modeling of the bulk properties of platinum (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). Therefore, for the purpose of determining the equilibrium lattice constant of platinum, the LDA/VWN functional is recommended, even though the use of GGA functionals may be advantageous when surface effects or gradient corrections are under consideration.\\n\\nB. k\u2013Point Mesh and Brillouin Zone Sampling  \\nA dense and adequately converged k\u2013point mesh is essential for metallic systems like platinum, where the Fermi surface must be sampled with high resolution. Convergence studies have shown that ensuring an energy difference of less than 5\u2005meV per atom between successive k\u2013point samplings is necessary to accurately capture the electronic structure (matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39). For bulk platinum, using 56 irreducible k\u2013points has been found to be sufficient to achieve such convergence (matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39). Other studies have recommended a 72-point k\u2013mesh for bulk calculations in conjunction with a Monkhorst\u2013Pack grid, while 19 k\u2013points have been suggested for simulations of platinum slab geometries to capture surface-related effects accurately (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). The choice between these recommendations may be guided by practical considerations such as computational cost and the specific electronic features of the system under investigation.\\n\\nC. Plane\u2013Wave Cutoff Energy  \\nThe plane\u2013wave cutoff energy determines the size of the basis set that is used to represent the electronic wave functions. For platinum, convergence studies have consistently indicated that a cutoff energy of 400\u2005eV is adequate to reduce the total energy error to below 5\u2005meV per atom (matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39). At this cutoff, the plane\u2013wave expansion is sufficiently complete to accurately represent both the localized d\u2013orbitals and the more delocalized electrons, ensuring reliable predictions of the lattice constant. Increasing the cutoff energy beyond 400\u2005eV typically results in diminishing returns, with only marginal improvements in energy convergence relative to the significant increase in computational effort.\\n\\nD. Convergence Criteria and Self\u2013Consistent Field (SCF) Mixing Schemes  \\nAchieving robust convergence during the self\u2013consistent field iterations is of paramount importance in DFT simulations, particularly for metal systems where the density of states near the Fermi level can cause oscillatory behavior. A common practice is to require that the energy difference between successive SCF iterations falls below a threshold of 10^\u20132\u2005atomic units (au), along with ensuring that the overall change in total energy is less than 5\u2005meV per atom (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6, matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39). The use of simple but effective mixing schemes\u2014such as a two\u2013point mixing of the Kohn\u2013Sham matrices, augmented by Pulay\u2019s Direct Inversion in the Iterative Subspace (DIIS) extrapolation\u2014has been demonstrated to enhance convergence significantly by dampening oscillations in electron density (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). These convergence strategies are critical to reliably obtaining the ground state energy minimum that corresponds to the correct equilibrium lattice constant.\\n\\nE. Additional Computational Considerations  \\nFor methods based on the full\u2013potential linearized augmented plane\u2013wave (FP-LAPW) formalism, additional parameters must be specified to ensure a high-quality basis set. Recommended settings for FP-LAPW calculations of platinum include an RKmax of 10.0 and a muffin\u2013tin radius of 2.08\u2005atomic units (a.u.), along with a uniform 16\u00d716\u00d716 Monk\u2013Pack k\u2013point mesh. These parameters have been shown to reproduce the electronic band structure of platinum with high accuracy, both with and without the inclusion of spin\u2013orbit coupling effects (sun2008latticedynamicsand pages 1-4). In the pseudopotential plane\u2013wave approach, it is essential to employ norm\u2013conserving pseudopotentials that accurately capture the behavior of the valence electrons outside the core region, thereby minimizing basis set incompleteness and reducing errors in the computed lattice constant (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 8-9, santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8). In some cases, counterpoise corrections are applied to further mitigate residual basis set superposition errors, which can be particularly relevant in systems where weak interactions are critical to the structural properties.\\n\\nV. Comparative Analysis between Experimental and DFT Results  \\nA detailed comparison between the experimental measurements and DFT predictions reveals a high degree of consistency when appropriate parameters are applied. As discussed, the experimental consensus for pure platinum rests at approximately 3.92\u2005\u00c5 (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8, ankudinov2002sensitivityofpt pages 6-7, arblaster1997crystallographicpropertiesof pages 3-6, evans1972thedeterminationof pages 4-8). DFT studies that employ the LDA/VWN functional typically yield lattice constants in very close agreement with this experimental value, with reported figures often falling around 3.92\u2005\u00c5 (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). By contrast, DFT simulations that use GGA functionals tend to overestimate the lattice constant slightly, with computed values ranging between 3.96\u2005\u00c5 and 4.00\u2005\u00c5 (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). Studies using the GPW formalism offer further insight into the sensitivity of the computed lattice constant to the simulation cell size: small supercells (e.g., 3\u00d73\u00d73) yield values around 3.955\u2005\u00c5, while larger supercells converge to approximately 3.965\u2005\u00c5 (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8, santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 8-9). FP-LAPW methods, known for their high level of accuracy, produce values in the range of 3.970\u2005\u00c5 to 3.980\u2005\u00c5, thereby slightly exceeding the experimental value but remaining within an acceptable margin of error given the inherent approximations of the exchange\u2013correlation functional (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16). Overall, these comparisons underscore that the best agreement with experiment is obtained when using the LDA/VWN functional combined with a dense k\u2013point mesh and a plane\u2013wave cutoff energy of 400\u2005eV.\\n\\nVI. Discussion on Methodological Considerations and Limitations  \\nDespite the apparent convergence between experimental and computational results for platinum\u2019s lattice constant, several methodological considerations warrant further discussion. One primary challenge in DFT predictions is the inherent dependency on the chosen exchange\u2013correlation functional. The LDA/VWN functional, while providing excellent convergence for the lattice constant, tends to neglect some of the subtle electron correlation effects that might influence other physical properties (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). Conversely, GGA functionals, by incorporating density-gradient corrections, introduce a slight expansion in the predicted unit cell. This systematic overestimation, typically in the order of 0.04\u20130.08\u2005\u00c5, is a well\u2013documented phenomenon that is independent of the specifics of k\u2013point sampling or cutoff energy (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). Although these deviations are relatively small, they can be significant when predicting properties that are highly sensitive to lattice spacing, such as adsorption energies on platinum surfaces or the cohesive energy in complex alloys.\\n\\nAnother key consideration is the choice of k\u2013point mesh and the associated convergence criteria. For metallic systems like platinum, the presence of a complex Fermi surface demands highly resolved k\u2013point integration. Several studies have demonstrated that an energy convergence threshold of 5\u2005meV per atom is necessary, with 56 irreducible k\u2013points providing a suitable balance between computational cost and accuracy (matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39). Nonetheless, alternative recommendations suggest that a denser k\u2013point grid\u2014such as 72 k\u2013points for bulk systems\u2014may further improve the convergence and reliability of the predicted lattice constant, particularly when additional electronic subtleties such as surface states are of interest (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). These recommendations highlight the need for systematic convergence testing in any DFT study to ensure that the selected parameters yield results that are both accurate and reproducible.\\n\\nThe plane\u2013wave cutoff energy is another critical numerical parameter. In the case of platinum, a cutoff of 400\u2005eV has been widely adopted based on extensive convergence studies (matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39). This choice ensures that the basis set is sufficiently complete to capture the full complexity of the electronic wave functions, including the localized d\u2013orbitals that are characteristic of transition metals. While increasing the cutoff energy beyond 400\u2005eV may further reduce numerical errors, the improvements are generally marginal relative to the computational expense incurred. Thus, the 400\u2005eV cutoff represents a practical compromise that has been validated across multiple studies.\\n\\nIn addition to these primary parameters, the selection of appropriate SCF mixing schemes plays a significant role in achieving reliable convergence. For platinum, a combination of two\u2013point mixing of the Kohn\u2013Sham matrices coupled with Pulay\u2019s DIIS has proven effective in stabilizing the iterative process, particularly when striving for an energy convergence criterion better than 10^\u20132\u2005au (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). This combination minimizes oscillatory behavior in the SCF cycle and ensures that the iterative procedure converges to the true ground state configuration. Such techniques are especially important in metallic systems, where the metallic density of states near the Fermi level can otherwise lead to pronounced numerical instabilities.\\n\\nFor methods employing the FP-LAPW approach, additional parameters such as the RKmax value and the muffin\u2013tin radius must be judiciously chosen to ensure an accurate representation of both the core and valence electrons. Recommended values\u2014RKmax set to 10.0 and the muffin\u2013tin radius set to 2.08\u2005a.u.\u2014have been shown to yield robust predictions for the lattice constant of platinum, with a concomitant high level of agreement with experiment (sun2008latticedynamicsand pages 1-4). Finally, the use of norm\u2013conserving pseudopotentials in the pseudopotential plane\u2013wave approach is crucial for accurately reproducing the behavior of the valence electron wave functions outside the core region. When these potentials are carefully generated and benchmarked against all\u2013electron methods, the resulting lattice constant predictions exhibit excellent agreement with both experimental data and FP-LAPW calculations (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 8-9, santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8).\\n\\nVII. Future Directions in DFT Simulation of Platinum  \\nLooking forward, several avenues exist for further improving the accuracy of DFT simulations of platinum. Although the current state\u2013of\u2013the\u2013art parameters yield lattice constants in very close agreement with experimental values, systematic errors arising from the inherent approximations in the exchange\u2013correlation functional persist. Future research may focus on the incorporation of improved functionals that go beyond the LDA and GGA approximations to include a more accurate treatment of electron correlation and nonlocal effects. Hybrid functionals, such as PBE0 or TPSSh, which have been found to perform well for platinum\u2013containing complexes (debefve2021systematicassessmentof pages 4-4, debefve2021systematicassessmentof pages 5-7), may offer enhanced accuracy when appropriately adapted for bulk systems.  \\n\\nFurthermore, additional emphasis on full relativistic corrections, including the explicit inclusion of spin\u2013orbit coupling effects, may prove important for properties beyond the equilibrium lattice constant, especially given platinum\u2019s status as a heavy transition metal. While many studies have demonstrated that scalar relativistic approximations capture the dominant effects on the lattice constant (sun2008latticedynamicsand pages 1-4), more sophisticated treatments that fully incorporate spin\u2013orbit interactions may be necessary when investigating subtle electronic structure features or surface phenomena. Similarly, the integration of ab initio molecular dynamics and density functional perturbation theory to account for finite\u2013temperature effects and anharmonic vibrational contributions constitutes another promising direction for maximum predictive accuracy.\\n\\nMachine learning and data\u2013driven approaches are emerging as powerful tools for parameter optimization and error minimization in DFT simulations. By automatically refining k\u2013point densities, plane\u2013wave cutoff values, and pseudopotential parameters based on training data from high\u2013precision experiments, such techniques have the potential to further narrow the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements. In this context, the development of automated workflows that systematically perform convergence tests and dynamically update simulation parameters will likely be a key focus of future research in computational materials science.\\n\\nVIII. Integration of Computational and Experimental Methodologies  \\nA salient feature of the platinum lattice constant studies is the remarkable consistency that has been achieved between experimental measurements and DFT predictions. High\u2013precision experimental techniques have established the lattice constant of pure platinum at approximately 3.92\u2005\u00c5, with outstanding reproducibility across different laboratories and measurement modalities (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8, arblaster1997crystallographicpropertiesof pages 3-6, ankudinov2002sensitivityofpt pages 6-7, evans1972thedeterminationof pages 4-8, wasserman1972onthedetermination pages 1-4). When DFT calculations employ the recommended parameters outlined above\u2014particularly the use of the LDA/VWN functional, dense k\u2013point sampling (ranging from 56 to 72 irreducible k\u2013points or equivalent Monk\u2013Pack grids), a plane\u2013wave cutoff energy of 400\u2005eV, and rigorous SCF convergence\u2014the computed equilibrium lattice constant aligns very closely with these experimental benchmarks (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6, matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39). In fact, many studies have demonstrated convergence of the DFT lattice constant to values as precise as 3.92\u2005\u00c5 when these best practices are followed rigorously.\\n\\nThis level of agreement between experiment and theory not only validates the theoretical methods but also provides a robust foundation for the predictive design of platinum\u2013based materials. The ability to accurately compute the lattice constant allows for reliable predictions of bulk modulus, cohesive energy, and other mechanical properties that are essential for various technological applications. Moreover, the iterative feedback between experimental measurements and computational simulations continues to be a driving force in refining both methodologies, ultimately enabling the design of platinum\u2013based catalysts, electronic devices, and alloys with tailored properties.\\n\\nIX. Implications for Material Properties and Applications  \\nThe lattice constant of platinum, as determined by both experimental and theoretical means, plays a central role in dictating numerous material properties. For instance, the bulk modulus, a measure of a material\u2019s resistance to compression, is directly related to the equilibrium volume of the crystal and, by extension, to the lattice constant. An accurate lattice constant allows for precise computations of the bulk modulus and the cohesive energy, which are critical for evaluating the mechanical stability of platinum-based materials. In catalytic applications, even slight variations in the lattice spacing can modify the adsorption energies of reactant molecules on platinum surfaces, thereby influencing the activity and selectivity of catalytic processes. Consequently, the predictive reliability of DFT in reproducing the experimental lattice constant lends significant credence to its broader applications in materials design. \\n\\nAdditionally, in electronic applications, the lattice constant is a key parameter in determining the electronic band structure of metals. It affects the dispersion of energy bands and the effective mass of charge carriers, factors that in turn influence the electrical conductivity and other transport properties. Since platinum is widely used in electronic contacts and interconnects, precise knowledge of its lattice structure is essential for optimizing device performance. The consistent agreement observed between DFT predictions and experimental measurements thus instills confidence in the use of these computational methods for the design and optimization of advanced platinum\u2013based systems.\\n\\nX. Summary and Conclusions  \\nIn summary, the body of experimental research reviewed herein consistently demonstrates that the equilibrium lattice constant of pure platinum is approximately 3.92\u2005\u00c5. Early crystallographic studies and subsequent high-precision measurements have reliably reported lattice constant values in the range of 3.922\u2005\u00c5 to 3.924\u2005\u00c5 (arblaster1997crystallographicpropertiesof pages 3-6, santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8, ankudinov2002sensitivityofpt pages 6-7, evans1972thedeterminationof pages 4-8, wasserman1972onthedetermination pages 1-4). In parallel, a wide array of DFT studies has been conducted to predict this fundamental parameter. DFT simulations that use the LDA/VWN functional have been shown to reproduce the experimental lattice constant with remarkable fidelity, yielding values around 3.92\u2005\u00c5 (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). In contrast, simulations employing GGA-type functionals tend to overestimate the lattice constant, producing values in the range of 3.96\u2005\u00c5 to 4.00\u2005\u00c5 (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). The Gaussian and Plane Wave (GPW) formalism, when applied with a careful treatment of supercell size, produces converged lattice constants of approximately 3.965\u2005\u00c5, while FP\u2013LAPW methods yield values near 3.97\u2005\u00c5 to 3.98\u2005\u00c5 (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8, santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 8-9).\\n\\nTo achieve these results, several key DFT parameters must be rigorously optimized. First, the choice of exchange\u2013correlation functional is paramount; the LDA/VWN functional is recommended for bulk platinum since it yields lattice constants in excellent agreement with the experimental benchmark (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). Second, the k\u2013point mesh must be sufficiently dense to resolve the metallic Fermi surface; convergence studies suggest that 56 irreducible k\u2013points are adequate for bulk systems, although some studies have employed up to 72 k\u2013points or equivalent Monk\u2013Pack grids, with slab calculations often requiring around 19 k\u2013points (matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39, kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). Third, a plane\u2013wave cutoff energy of 400\u2005eV is widely validated as sufficient to ensure convergence of the total energy to within 5\u2005meV per atom (matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39). Fourth, it is essential to apply strict convergence criteria during the SCF procedure\u2014typically an energy threshold below 10^\u20132\u2005au per iteration\u2014and to employ effective mixing schemes such as a two\u2013point mixing coupled with Pulay\u2019s DIIS to ensure rapid and stable convergence (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). Additionally, for FP\u2013LAPW calculations, setting an RKmax of 10.0 and a muffin\u2013tin radius of 2.08\u2005a.u. has been shown to yield accurate electronic structures (sun2008latticedynamicsand pages 1-4). Finally, the use of norm\u2013conserving pseudopotentials is critical in the pseudopotential approach, ensuring an accurate description of the valence electron wave functions and minimizing errors due to basis set incompleteness (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 8-9, santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8).\\n\\nDespite the inevitable approximations inherent in the exchange\u2013correlation functionals and the potential for numerical discretization errors, the overall consistency between experimental measurements and DFT predictions provides strong evidence for the reliability of modern computational methods for benchmarking the fundamental properties of platinum. Future improvements may involve the application of hybrid functionals, the inclusion of full relativistic effects, and the adoption of machine learning techniques for adaptive parameter optimization. Such advancements are expected to further refine the predictive capabilities of DFT, enabling even more accurate and efficient simulation of platinum and related materials.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the lattice constant of pure platinum is experimentally established at approximately 3.92\u2005\u00c5, and DFT simulations\u2014when executed with carefully chosen and rigorously converged parameters (such as the use of the LDA/VWN functional, a dense k\u2013point mesh with 56 to 72 irreducible k\u2013points, a plane\u2013wave cutoff energy of 400\u2005eV, and SCF convergence criteria of 5\u2005meV per atom or better)\u2014yield predictions that are in excellent agreement with this experimental benchmark (arblaster1997crystallographicpropertiesof pages 3-6, matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39, santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8, kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6, beckstein2001firstprincipleselasticconstants pages 11-14). The synergy between experimental and theoretical investigations not only reinforces the fundamental understanding of platinum\u2019s crystallographic properties but also underpins its continued technological significance in various advanced applications.\",\"formatted_answer\":\"Question: What are the previously reported values for the lattice constant of platinum (Pt) from both experimental measurements and computational simulations, and how can this property be accurately computed using density functional theory (DFT)? Please include validated and recommended DFT parameters such as exchange-correlation functional, k-point mesh, plane-wave cutoff energy, and any relevant convergence criteria.\\n\\nThis report provides a comprehensive analysis of the reported lattice constant of platinum (Pt) based on both experimental measurements and density functional theory (DFT) simulations. Platinum is widely used in catalytic, electronic, and structural applications, and its performance critically depends on its atomic structure. In particular, the lattice constant is a key parameter that not only affects the bulk modulus and cohesive energy but also influences surface reactivity and electronic properties. An accurate understanding of this constant is vital for predictive materials design. In what follows, we review the experimental consensus as well as the outcomes of various computational studies, and we detail the recommended DFT parameters\u2014including exchange\u2013correlation functionals, k\u2013point meshes, plane\u2013wave cutoff energies, and convergence criteria\u2014that are necessary for accurate DFT predictions of platinum\u2019s equilibrium lattice constant.\\n\\nI. Introduction  \\nThe quest for a precise determination of platinum\u2019s lattice constant has spanned decades of experimental and theoretical research. Experimentally, high-resolution techniques such as X-ray diffraction and dilatometry have established the value with a very high degree of precision. Computationally, DFT has emerged as the tool of choice for predicting not only the lattice constant itself but also other derived mechanical and electronic properties. However, the accuracy of DFT predictions depends critically on the careful selection of key parameters, notably the exchange\u2013correlation functional, the density of k\u2013point sampling in the Brillouin zone, the plane\u2013wave cutoff energy, and the convergence criteria applied to the self-consistent field (SCF) procedure. The following sections elaborate on the experimental findings and the theoretical techniques that have been used to determine the lattice constant of platinum, discussing both the inherent challenges and the strategies employed to overcome them.\\n\\nII. Experimental Measurements of the Platinum Lattice Constant  \\nA broad range of experimental investigations have reported highly convergent values for the lattice constant of platinum. Early work conducted by Van Arkel, Stenzel, Weerts, Owen, Yates, Moeller, Esch, Schneider, Goldschmidt, Land, Grube, Swanson, Tatge, Kidron, Evans, Fischer, Schroder, Waseda, Hirata, Ohtani, Stankus, and Khairulin found values ranging from 0.39223\u2005nm to 0.39244\u2005nm (arblaster1997crystallographicpropertiesof pages 3-6). When converted to angstroms, these figures correspond approximately to 3.9223\u2005\u00c5 to 3.9244\u2005\u00c5, which establishes a narrow window of uncertainty for pure platinum at room temperature. Other experimental studies, including those that report the lattice constant as 3.92\u2005\u00c5, further reinforce the reliability of these measurements (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8, ankudinov2002sensitivityofpt pages 6-7). In addition, ASTM standards, along with subsequent investigations by Evans, Fischer, and collaborators, have converged on a consensus value of 3.9231\u2005\u00c5 with extremely low uncertainty (on the order of \u00b10.0003\u2005\u00c5) (evans1972thedeterminationof pages 4-8, wasserman1972onthedetermination pages 1-4). It is also noteworthy that some studies report the lattice constant in atomic units\u2014for example, Beckstein and colleagues have reported an experimental value of 7.415\u2005a.u., which, when converted using the standard conversion factor (1\u2005a.u. = 0.529177\u2005\u00c5), is equivalent to approximately 3.92\u2005\u00c5 (beckstein2001firstprincipleselasticconstants pages 11-14). While certain investigations\u2014especially those involving alloys or samples subjected to extreme conditions\u2014have yielded lattice constant values ranging from as low as 3.52\u2005\u00c5 to as high as 3.97\u2005\u00c5 (zhang2020hydrogenadsorptionon pages 6-11), these deviations are typically associated with compositional variations or nonambient experimental conditions rather than with any intrinsic uncertainty in the lattice constant of pure platinum. Thus, the experimental data set provides a robust benchmark, indicating that the equilibrium lattice constant of pure platinum is consistently near 3.92\u2005\u00c5.\\n\\nIII. Computational Predictions of the Platinum Lattice Constant  \\nDensity functional theory has been applied extensively to predict the lattice constant of platinum. The computational results, however, demonstrate a marked sensitivity to the choice of exchange\u2013correlation functional and other numerical parameters. In particular, DFT studies employing the Local Density Approximation (LDA) with the Vosko\u2013Wilk\u2013Nusair (VWN) correlation functional consistently yield lattice constants that closely match the experimental benchmark of approximately 3.92\u2005\u00c5 (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). In contrast, simulations that utilize Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) functionals\u2014such as the Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof (PBE), BPW91, and BLYP functionals\u2014tend to predict slightly larger lattice constants, with reported values typically falling in the range of 3.96\u2005\u00c5 to 4.00\u2005\u00c5 (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). \\n\\nSeveral studies have specifically employed the Gaussian and Plane Wave (GPW) formalism to evaluate platinum\u2019s equilibrium lattice constant. In these investigations, the computed lattice constant shows a subtle dependence on the size of the supercell used in the simulations. For instance, a 3\u00d73\u00d73 supercell yields a lattice constant of about 3.955\u2005\u00c5, whereas larger supercells (4\u00d74\u00d74, 5\u00d75\u00d75, or 6\u00d76\u00d76) converge to approximately 3.965\u2005\u00c5 (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8, santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 8-9). Alternative methodologies, such as full\u2013potential linearized augmented plane\u2013wave (FP-LAPW) methods, have produced lattice constant values that are marginally higher, generally ranging from 3.970\u2005\u00c5 to 3.980\u2005\u00c5. Additionally, methods based on the CO\u2013LCAO approach have yielded lattice constants of up to 3.990\u2005\u00c5. These variations underscore the well-known dependency of DFT-predicted structural properties on the chosen exchange\u2013correlation treatment and basis set completeness. It is clear from the literature that while the LDA/VWN approach offers excellent agreement with experiment, GGA-based methods introduce a modest expansion of the unit cell that can lead to overestimations of the lattice constant.\\n\\nIV. Recommended DFT Parameters for Accurate Lattice Constant Computations  \\nA critical requirement for achieving accurate DFT predictions of the platinum lattice constant lies in the careful selection and optimization of computational parameters. The following subsections detail the recommended choices and best practices based on the available literature.\\n\\nA. Exchange\u2013Correlation Functional  \\nThe exchange\u2013correlation functional is one of the most decisive parameters influencing the predicted lattice constant. Empirical evidence from several studies supports the use of the LDA/VWN functional for bulk platinum due to its propensity to slightly contract the electron density, thereby reproducing the experimentally observed lattice constant of approximately 3.92\u2005\u00c5 (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). Although GGA functionals, such as PBE and BPW91, include gradient corrections that typically improve descriptions of electronic inhomogeneities, these corrections often result in predictions that are 0.04\u2005\u00c5 to 0.08\u2005\u00c5 larger than the experimental benchmark (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). In addition, the BLYP functional has been observed to yield even larger lattice constants and less satisfactory cohesive properties, suggesting that it may not be appropriate for the accurate modeling of the bulk properties of platinum (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). Therefore, for the purpose of determining the equilibrium lattice constant of platinum, the LDA/VWN functional is recommended, even though the use of GGA functionals may be advantageous when surface effects or gradient corrections are under consideration.\\n\\nB. k\u2013Point Mesh and Brillouin Zone Sampling  \\nA dense and adequately converged k\u2013point mesh is essential for metallic systems like platinum, where the Fermi surface must be sampled with high resolution. Convergence studies have shown that ensuring an energy difference of less than 5\u2005meV per atom between successive k\u2013point samplings is necessary to accurately capture the electronic structure (matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39). For bulk platinum, using 56 irreducible k\u2013points has been found to be sufficient to achieve such convergence (matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39). Other studies have recommended a 72-point k\u2013mesh for bulk calculations in conjunction with a Monkhorst\u2013Pack grid, while 19 k\u2013points have been suggested for simulations of platinum slab geometries to capture surface-related effects accurately (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). The choice between these recommendations may be guided by practical considerations such as computational cost and the specific electronic features of the system under investigation.\\n\\nC. Plane\u2013Wave Cutoff Energy  \\nThe plane\u2013wave cutoff energy determines the size of the basis set that is used to represent the electronic wave functions. For platinum, convergence studies have consistently indicated that a cutoff energy of 400\u2005eV is adequate to reduce the total energy error to below 5\u2005meV per atom (matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39). At this cutoff, the plane\u2013wave expansion is sufficiently complete to accurately represent both the localized d\u2013orbitals and the more delocalized electrons, ensuring reliable predictions of the lattice constant. Increasing the cutoff energy beyond 400\u2005eV typically results in diminishing returns, with only marginal improvements in energy convergence relative to the significant increase in computational effort.\\n\\nD. Convergence Criteria and Self\u2013Consistent Field (SCF) Mixing Schemes  \\nAchieving robust convergence during the self\u2013consistent field iterations is of paramount importance in DFT simulations, particularly for metal systems where the density of states near the Fermi level can cause oscillatory behavior. A common practice is to require that the energy difference between successive SCF iterations falls below a threshold of 10^\u20132\u2005atomic units (au), along with ensuring that the overall change in total energy is less than 5\u2005meV per atom (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6, matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39). The use of simple but effective mixing schemes\u2014such as a two\u2013point mixing of the Kohn\u2013Sham matrices, augmented by Pulay\u2019s Direct Inversion in the Iterative Subspace (DIIS) extrapolation\u2014has been demonstrated to enhance convergence significantly by dampening oscillations in electron density (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). These convergence strategies are critical to reliably obtaining the ground state energy minimum that corresponds to the correct equilibrium lattice constant.\\n\\nE. Additional Computational Considerations  \\nFor methods based on the full\u2013potential linearized augmented plane\u2013wave (FP-LAPW) formalism, additional parameters must be specified to ensure a high-quality basis set. Recommended settings for FP-LAPW calculations of platinum include an RKmax of 10.0 and a muffin\u2013tin radius of 2.08\u2005atomic units (a.u.), along with a uniform 16\u00d716\u00d716 Monk\u2013Pack k\u2013point mesh. These parameters have been shown to reproduce the electronic band structure of platinum with high accuracy, both with and without the inclusion of spin\u2013orbit coupling effects (sun2008latticedynamicsand pages 1-4). In the pseudopotential plane\u2013wave approach, it is essential to employ norm\u2013conserving pseudopotentials that accurately capture the behavior of the valence electrons outside the core region, thereby minimizing basis set incompleteness and reducing errors in the computed lattice constant (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 8-9, santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8). In some cases, counterpoise corrections are applied to further mitigate residual basis set superposition errors, which can be particularly relevant in systems where weak interactions are critical to the structural properties.\\n\\nV. Comparative Analysis between Experimental and DFT Results  \\nA detailed comparison between the experimental measurements and DFT predictions reveals a high degree of consistency when appropriate parameters are applied. As discussed, the experimental consensus for pure platinum rests at approximately 3.92\u2005\u00c5 (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8, ankudinov2002sensitivityofpt pages 6-7, arblaster1997crystallographicpropertiesof pages 3-6, evans1972thedeterminationof pages 4-8). DFT studies that employ the LDA/VWN functional typically yield lattice constants in very close agreement with this experimental value, with reported figures often falling around 3.92\u2005\u00c5 (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). By contrast, DFT simulations that use GGA functionals tend to overestimate the lattice constant slightly, with computed values ranging between 3.96\u2005\u00c5 and 4.00\u2005\u00c5 (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). Studies using the GPW formalism offer further insight into the sensitivity of the computed lattice constant to the simulation cell size: small supercells (e.g., 3\u00d73\u00d73) yield values around 3.955\u2005\u00c5, while larger supercells converge to approximately 3.965\u2005\u00c5 (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8, santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 8-9). FP-LAPW methods, known for their high level of accuracy, produce values in the range of 3.970\u2005\u00c5 to 3.980\u2005\u00c5, thereby slightly exceeding the experimental value but remaining within an acceptable margin of error given the inherent approximations of the exchange\u2013correlation functional (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8, feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16). Overall, these comparisons underscore that the best agreement with experiment is obtained when using the LDA/VWN functional combined with a dense k\u2013point mesh and a plane\u2013wave cutoff energy of 400\u2005eV.\\n\\nVI. Discussion on Methodological Considerations and Limitations  \\nDespite the apparent convergence between experimental and computational results for platinum\u2019s lattice constant, several methodological considerations warrant further discussion. One primary challenge in DFT predictions is the inherent dependency on the chosen exchange\u2013correlation functional. The LDA/VWN functional, while providing excellent convergence for the lattice constant, tends to neglect some of the subtle electron correlation effects that might influence other physical properties (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). Conversely, GGA functionals, by incorporating density-gradient corrections, introduce a slight expansion in the predicted unit cell. This systematic overestimation, typically in the order of 0.04\u20130.08\u2005\u00c5, is a well\u2013documented phenomenon that is independent of the specifics of k\u2013point sampling or cutoff energy (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). Although these deviations are relatively small, they can be significant when predicting properties that are highly sensitive to lattice spacing, such as adsorption energies on platinum surfaces or the cohesive energy in complex alloys.\\n\\nAnother key consideration is the choice of k\u2013point mesh and the associated convergence criteria. For metallic systems like platinum, the presence of a complex Fermi surface demands highly resolved k\u2013point integration. Several studies have demonstrated that an energy convergence threshold of 5\u2005meV per atom is necessary, with 56 irreducible k\u2013points providing a suitable balance between computational cost and accuracy (matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39). Nonetheless, alternative recommendations suggest that a denser k\u2013point grid\u2014such as 72 k\u2013points for bulk systems\u2014may further improve the convergence and reliability of the predicted lattice constant, particularly when additional electronic subtleties such as surface states are of interest (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). These recommendations highlight the need for systematic convergence testing in any DFT study to ensure that the selected parameters yield results that are both accurate and reproducible.\\n\\nThe plane\u2013wave cutoff energy is another critical numerical parameter. In the case of platinum, a cutoff of 400\u2005eV has been widely adopted based on extensive convergence studies (matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39). This choice ensures that the basis set is sufficiently complete to capture the full complexity of the electronic wave functions, including the localized d\u2013orbitals that are characteristic of transition metals. While increasing the cutoff energy beyond 400\u2005eV may further reduce numerical errors, the improvements are generally marginal relative to the computational expense incurred. Thus, the 400\u2005eV cutoff represents a practical compromise that has been validated across multiple studies.\\n\\nIn addition to these primary parameters, the selection of appropriate SCF mixing schemes plays a significant role in achieving reliable convergence. For platinum, a combination of two\u2013point mixing of the Kohn\u2013Sham matrices coupled with Pulay\u2019s DIIS has proven effective in stabilizing the iterative process, particularly when striving for an energy convergence criterion better than 10^\u20132\u2005au (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). This combination minimizes oscillatory behavior in the SCF cycle and ensures that the iterative procedure converges to the true ground state configuration. Such techniques are especially important in metallic systems, where the metallic density of states near the Fermi level can otherwise lead to pronounced numerical instabilities.\\n\\nFor methods employing the FP-LAPW approach, additional parameters such as the RKmax value and the muffin\u2013tin radius must be judiciously chosen to ensure an accurate representation of both the core and valence electrons. Recommended values\u2014RKmax set to 10.0 and the muffin\u2013tin radius set to 2.08\u2005a.u.\u2014have been shown to yield robust predictions for the lattice constant of platinum, with a concomitant high level of agreement with experiment (sun2008latticedynamicsand pages 1-4). Finally, the use of norm\u2013conserving pseudopotentials in the pseudopotential plane\u2013wave approach is crucial for accurately reproducing the behavior of the valence electron wave functions outside the core region. When these potentials are carefully generated and benchmarked against all\u2013electron methods, the resulting lattice constant predictions exhibit excellent agreement with both experimental data and FP-LAPW calculations (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 8-9, santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8).\\n\\nVII. Future Directions in DFT Simulation of Platinum  \\nLooking forward, several avenues exist for further improving the accuracy of DFT simulations of platinum. Although the current state\u2013of\u2013the\u2013art parameters yield lattice constants in very close agreement with experimental values, systematic errors arising from the inherent approximations in the exchange\u2013correlation functional persist. Future research may focus on the incorporation of improved functionals that go beyond the LDA and GGA approximations to include a more accurate treatment of electron correlation and nonlocal effects. Hybrid functionals, such as PBE0 or TPSSh, which have been found to perform well for platinum\u2013containing complexes (debefve2021systematicassessmentof pages 4-4, debefve2021systematicassessmentof pages 5-7), may offer enhanced accuracy when appropriately adapted for bulk systems.  \\n\\nFurthermore, additional emphasis on full relativistic corrections, including the explicit inclusion of spin\u2013orbit coupling effects, may prove important for properties beyond the equilibrium lattice constant, especially given platinum\u2019s status as a heavy transition metal. While many studies have demonstrated that scalar relativistic approximations capture the dominant effects on the lattice constant (sun2008latticedynamicsand pages 1-4), more sophisticated treatments that fully incorporate spin\u2013orbit interactions may be necessary when investigating subtle electronic structure features or surface phenomena. Similarly, the integration of ab initio molecular dynamics and density functional perturbation theory to account for finite\u2013temperature effects and anharmonic vibrational contributions constitutes another promising direction for maximum predictive accuracy.\\n\\nMachine learning and data\u2013driven approaches are emerging as powerful tools for parameter optimization and error minimization in DFT simulations. By automatically refining k\u2013point densities, plane\u2013wave cutoff values, and pseudopotential parameters based on training data from high\u2013precision experiments, such techniques have the potential to further narrow the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements. In this context, the development of automated workflows that systematically perform convergence tests and dynamically update simulation parameters will likely be a key focus of future research in computational materials science.\\n\\nVIII. Integration of Computational and Experimental Methodologies  \\nA salient feature of the platinum lattice constant studies is the remarkable consistency that has been achieved between experimental measurements and DFT predictions. High\u2013precision experimental techniques have established the lattice constant of pure platinum at approximately 3.92\u2005\u00c5, with outstanding reproducibility across different laboratories and measurement modalities (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8, arblaster1997crystallographicpropertiesof pages 3-6, ankudinov2002sensitivityofpt pages 6-7, evans1972thedeterminationof pages 4-8, wasserman1972onthedetermination pages 1-4). When DFT calculations employ the recommended parameters outlined above\u2014particularly the use of the LDA/VWN functional, dense k\u2013point sampling (ranging from 56 to 72 irreducible k\u2013points or equivalent Monk\u2013Pack grids), a plane\u2013wave cutoff energy of 400\u2005eV, and rigorous SCF convergence\u2014the computed equilibrium lattice constant aligns very closely with these experimental benchmarks (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6, matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39). In fact, many studies have demonstrated convergence of the DFT lattice constant to values as precise as 3.92\u2005\u00c5 when these best practices are followed rigorously.\\n\\nThis level of agreement between experiment and theory not only validates the theoretical methods but also provides a robust foundation for the predictive design of platinum\u2013based materials. The ability to accurately compute the lattice constant allows for reliable predictions of bulk modulus, cohesive energy, and other mechanical properties that are essential for various technological applications. Moreover, the iterative feedback between experimental measurements and computational simulations continues to be a driving force in refining both methodologies, ultimately enabling the design of platinum\u2013based catalysts, electronic devices, and alloys with tailored properties.\\n\\nIX. Implications for Material Properties and Applications  \\nThe lattice constant of platinum, as determined by both experimental and theoretical means, plays a central role in dictating numerous material properties. For instance, the bulk modulus, a measure of a material\u2019s resistance to compression, is directly related to the equilibrium volume of the crystal and, by extension, to the lattice constant. An accurate lattice constant allows for precise computations of the bulk modulus and the cohesive energy, which are critical for evaluating the mechanical stability of platinum-based materials. In catalytic applications, even slight variations in the lattice spacing can modify the adsorption energies of reactant molecules on platinum surfaces, thereby influencing the activity and selectivity of catalytic processes. Consequently, the predictive reliability of DFT in reproducing the experimental lattice constant lends significant credence to its broader applications in materials design. \\n\\nAdditionally, in electronic applications, the lattice constant is a key parameter in determining the electronic band structure of metals. It affects the dispersion of energy bands and the effective mass of charge carriers, factors that in turn influence the electrical conductivity and other transport properties. Since platinum is widely used in electronic contacts and interconnects, precise knowledge of its lattice structure is essential for optimizing device performance. The consistent agreement observed between DFT predictions and experimental measurements thus instills confidence in the use of these computational methods for the design and optimization of advanced platinum\u2013based systems.\\n\\nX. Summary and Conclusions  \\nIn summary, the body of experimental research reviewed herein consistently demonstrates that the equilibrium lattice constant of pure platinum is approximately 3.92\u2005\u00c5. Early crystallographic studies and subsequent high-precision measurements have reliably reported lattice constant values in the range of 3.922\u2005\u00c5 to 3.924\u2005\u00c5 (arblaster1997crystallographicpropertiesof pages 3-6, santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8, ankudinov2002sensitivityofpt pages 6-7, evans1972thedeterminationof pages 4-8, wasserman1972onthedetermination pages 1-4). In parallel, a wide array of DFT studies has been conducted to predict this fundamental parameter. DFT simulations that use the LDA/VWN functional have been shown to reproduce the experimental lattice constant with remarkable fidelity, yielding values around 3.92\u2005\u00c5 (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). In contrast, simulations employing GGA-type functionals tend to overestimate the lattice constant, producing values in the range of 3.96\u2005\u00c5 to 4.00\u2005\u00c5 (feibelman2001thecopt(111)puzzle pages 11-16, kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). The Gaussian and Plane Wave (GPW) formalism, when applied with a careful treatment of supercell size, produces converged lattice constants of approximately 3.965\u2005\u00c5, while FP\u2013LAPW methods yield values near 3.97\u2005\u00c5 to 3.98\u2005\u00c5 (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8, santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 8-9).\\n\\nTo achieve these results, several key DFT parameters must be rigorously optimized. First, the choice of exchange\u2013correlation functional is paramount; the LDA/VWN functional is recommended for bulk platinum since it yields lattice constants in excellent agreement with the experimental benchmark (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). Second, the k\u2013point mesh must be sufficiently dense to resolve the metallic Fermi surface; convergence studies suggest that 56 irreducible k\u2013points are adequate for bulk systems, although some studies have employed up to 72 k\u2013points or equivalent Monk\u2013Pack grids, with slab calculations often requiring around 19 k\u2013points (matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39, kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). Third, a plane\u2013wave cutoff energy of 400\u2005eV is widely validated as sufficient to ensure convergence of the total energy to within 5\u2005meV per atom (matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39). Fourth, it is essential to apply strict convergence criteria during the SCF procedure\u2014typically an energy threshold below 10^\u20132\u2005au per iteration\u2014and to employ effective mixing schemes such as a two\u2013point mixing coupled with Pulay\u2019s DIIS to ensure rapid and stable convergence (kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6). Additionally, for FP\u2013LAPW calculations, setting an RKmax of 10.0 and a muffin\u2013tin radius of 2.08\u2005a.u. has been shown to yield accurate electronic structures (sun2008latticedynamicsand pages 1-4). Finally, the use of norm\u2013conserving pseudopotentials is critical in the pseudopotential approach, ensuring an accurate description of the valence electron wave functions and minimizing errors due to basis set incompleteness (santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 8-9, santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8).\\n\\nDespite the inevitable approximations inherent in the exchange\u2013correlation functionals and the potential for numerical discretization errors, the overall consistency between experimental measurements and DFT predictions provides strong evidence for the reliability of modern computational methods for benchmarking the fundamental properties of platinum. Future improvements may involve the application of hybrid functionals, the inclusion of full relativistic effects, and the adoption of machine learning techniques for adaptive parameter optimization. Such advancements are expected to further refine the predictive capabilities of DFT, enabling even more accurate and efficient simulation of platinum and related materials.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the lattice constant of pure platinum is experimentally established at approximately 3.92\u2005\u00c5, and DFT simulations\u2014when executed with carefully chosen and rigorously converged parameters (such as the use of the LDA/VWN functional, a dense k\u2013point mesh with 56 to 72 irreducible k\u2013points, a plane\u2013wave cutoff energy of 400\u2005eV, and SCF convergence criteria of 5\u2005meV per atom or better)\u2014yield predictions that are in excellent agreement with this experimental benchmark (arblaster1997crystallographicpropertiesof pages 3-6, matengaifa2014adsorptionofoxygen pages 34-39, santarossa2008modelingbulkand pages 7-8, kokalj1999periodicdensityfunctional pages 4-6, beckstein2001firstprincipleselasticconstants pages 11-14). The synergy between experimental and theoretical investigations not only reinforces the fundamental understanding of platinum\u2019s crystallographic properties but also underpins its continued technological significance in various advanced applications.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.
